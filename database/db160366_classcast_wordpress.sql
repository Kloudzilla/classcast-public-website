No matter how fast your code is, if your server itself isn&#8217;t running to it&#8217;s maximum performance, you&#8217;re not delivering your site as fast as you could be. By setting up <a href="http://nginx.org/">Nginx</a> and the new <a href="http://hhvm.com/">HHVM</a>, you can get your server delivering fully loaded pages faster than most servers answer a request.</p>\n<blockquote><p>HHVM is an open-source virtual machine designed for executing programs written in Hackand PHP. HHVM uses a just-in-time (JIT) compilation approach to achieve superior performance while maintaining the development flexibility that PHP provides.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is worth noting that HHVM isn&#8217;t 100% compatible with all of PHP, so if you&#8217;re using obscure functions, you may run into an issue. In all of my testing of WordPress, I never once had this problem, but it is something to keep in mind.</p>\n<p>In this post, we&#8217;ll set up both Nginx and HHVM from scratch, and then install and setup WordPress. If you follow this guide, you can have an insanely fast server setup in less than an hour.</p>\n<p>This post is written for specifically Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and 14.04 LTS. The steps outlined will probably work on other versions, and with some modifications most likely anywhere. I prefer Ubuntu, though. I&#8217;ll be going through this on a Ubuntu 14.04 LTS installation.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m taking these steps on a brand new <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> VPS droplet, but you can use the server of your choice.</p>\n<p>We want to start with a brand new installation, and install everything we will need. Our first step is updating all of the built in software, and then installing some small useful tools we will want.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-perl">$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install -y unzip vim git-core curl wget build-essential\n</pre>\n<p>The &#8216;-y&#8217; flag we&#8217;re using for &#8216;apt-get install&#8217; will tell apt that we want to answer &#8216;Yes&#8217; to every question about whether or not we want to install a package. Because we&#8217;re also running as root (sudo), we want to only install from trusted sources, like the ones that are already added to Ubuntu.</p>\n<p>We now want to install Nginx. It&#8217;s also possible to run HHVM with Apache, but our goal is speed and performance so we want to use Nginx. Nginx is a reverse proxy server, as well as a normal web server, and also gives us nice load balancing and caching.</p>\n<p>The entire goal of Nginx and HHVM is to speed up everything our webserver does to create our final HTML pages that WordPress generates.</p>\n<p>Installing Nginx is actually super simple on a new Ubuntu installation. We tell &#8216;apt&#8217;, our handy package manager how to find Nginx, and then we can just do a &#8216;apt-get install&#8217; like we did previously.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-perl">$ sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:nginx/mainline</pre>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-8273 size-full" src="http://webdevstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1.png" alt="1" width="476" height="156" /></p>\n<p>After we do this, we want to do another at-get update to fetch the Nginx package we just told &#8216;apt&#8217; about. Now we&#8217;re ready to install Nginx.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-perl">$ sudo apt-get install -y nginx</pre>\n<p>That&#8217;s it! Nginx is installed. We&#8217;ll configure it in just a bit.</p>\n<p>Now we&#8217;re ready to install HHVM. For Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04, we can follow the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki/Prebuilt-Packages-on-Ubuntu-12.04">official guide</a>.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-perl">Ubuntu 12.04:\n$ sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:mapnik/boost\n$ wget -O - http://dl.hhvm.com/conf/hhvm.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -\n$ echo deb http://dl.hhvm.com/ubuntu precise main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hhvm.list\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install -y hhvm\n\n\nUbuntu 14.04:\n$ wget -O - http://dl.hhvm.com/conf/hhvm.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -\n$ echo deb http://dl.hhvm.com/ubuntu trusty main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hhvm.list\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install -y hhvm\n</pre>\n<p>So far, everything goes pretty smoothly. The longest part is probably waiting for the server to pull in all of the packages for the &#8216;apt-get update&#8217; every time.</p>\n<p>After installing HHVM, we get a pretty handy message.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-perl">********************************************************************\n* HHVM is installed. Here are some more things you might want to do:\n* \n* Configure your webserver to use HHVM:\n* $ sudo /usr/share/hhvm/install_fastcgi.sh\n* $ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart\n* $ sudo /etc/init.d/apache restart\n* $ sudo /etc/init.d/hhvm restart\n* \n* Start HHVM at boot:\n* $ sudo update-rc.d hhvm defaults\n* \n* Run command line scripts with HHVM:\n* $ hhvm whatever.php\n* \n* Use HHVM for /usr/bin/php even if you have php-cli installed:\n* $ sudo /usr/bin/update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/php php /usr/bin/hhvm 60\n********************************************************************</pre>\n<p>This is nice because it tells us how to do our next few steps.</p>\n<p>First we&#8217;ll run the first of the commands they tell us about to resart Nginx and install FastCGI using HHVM.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-perl">$ sudo /usr/share/hhvm/install_fastcgi.sh\n</pre>\n<p>After this, we want to tell Ubuntu to run HHVM on system start.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-perl">$ sudo update-rc.d hhvm defaults</pre>\n<p>And then we&#8217;ll restart HHVM, just for good measure.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-perl">$ sudo service hhvm restart  </pre>\n<p>At this point, HHVM is currently running, and will run whenever our server is started up. We can verify that HHVM is installed by creating a PHP file and making sure that HHVM can run it.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-perl">$ touch test.php\n$ echo &quot; test.php\n$ hhvm test.php</pre>\n<p>We should get a return of &#8220;HipHop&#8221;. If that&#8217;s what you see, we know that HHVM is working perfectly.</p>\n<p>At this point, we can start setting up the configuration for a website, but before we do that, there&#8217;s another handy command that our HHVM installation results screen gave us to have HHVM &#8220;pretend&#8221; to be PHP over the command line.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-perl">$ sudo /usr/bin/update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/php php /usr/bin/hhvm 60</pre>\n<p>What this lets us do is use PHP command line tools like WPCLI, PHPUnit, Composer, and all of those things, just like if we were running PHP instead of HHVM.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s test this real quick by doing:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-perl">$ php -v</pre>\n<p>You should get a result like this:</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-8284 size-full" src="http://webdevstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/3.png" alt="3" width="509" height="69" /></p>\n<p>One really nice thing about HHVM and Nginx is there is very little configuration we need to do to start working. We don&#8217;t really have to do anything at all and it is already running. The default file location of our files is &#8220;/usr/share/nginx/html&#8221;, and there is already a simple HTML file there. I like to make an alias so that I can quickly get to this location.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-perl">$ echo  &quot;www=\\&quot;cd /usr/share/nginx/html\\&quot;&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc\n</pre>\n<p>This creates an alias so we can simply type &#8220;www&#8221; and change to our file directory.</p>\n<p>At this point we want to install MySQL, so that we can actually use WordPress, and not just PHP files. Oddly, this portion has more configuration then anything we&#8217;ve done up to this point. After running the following command, we&#8217;ll get a password screen to set our root password.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-perl">$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server</pre>\n<p><a href="http://webdevstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-8299 size-medium" src="http://webdevstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4-300x243.png" alt="4" width="300" height="243" /></a></p>\n<p>Now we&#8217;re ready to install WordPress and set up Nginx to work with it.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re going to head to our Nginx HTML folder and grab a copy of wordpress and unzip it.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-perl">$ cd /usr/share/nginx/html\n$ wget http://wordpress.org/latest.zip\n$ unzip latest.zip\n</pre>\n<p>And we&#8217;ll also do a little housekeeping while we&#8217;re here.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-perl">$ mv wordpress/* .\n$ rmdir wordpress\n$ rm latest.zip\n$ rm index.html</pre>\n<p>Now we&#8217;ll set up our MySQL database.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-perl">$ mysql -u root -pYOURPASSWORDHERE\n</pre>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-8300 size-full" src="http://webdevstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/5.png" alt="5" width="565" height="184" /></p>\n<p>Now we&#8217;re inside a MySQL prompt inside our SSH prompt inside our terminal program. Prompt-ception!</p>\n<p>First we create a database, and then add a user, set that user&#8217;s password, give that user permissions, refresh MySQL privileges, and then exit out of our MySQL prompt. Make sure you write down this information, as you&#8217;ll need it for wp-config.php later.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-perl">$ create database databasename;\n$ create user username@localhost;\n$ set password for username@localhost = password(&quot;yourpasswordhere&quot;);\n$ grant all privileges on databasename.* to username@localhost identified by ''yourpasswordhere'';\n$ flush privileges;\n$ exit;</pre>\n<p>And now let&#8217;s create and edit wp-config.php. To edit the file, you can either SFTP in and edit this file locally, or use Nano or Vim on the server. We&#8217;ll use Vim.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-perl">$ cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php\n$ vi wp-config.php </pre>\n<p>For Vi, to start typing you want to hit &#8216;i&#8217; to go into insert mode, and when you&#8217;re ready to save and quit, just hit &#8216;ESC&#8217; and then &#8216;:wq&#8217;. It&#8217;s confusing, I know.</p>\n<p>At this point, we&#8217;re ready to set up Nginx to be able to run WordPress.

Before that, he played with various other open source platforms and the first incarnation of his blog was written entirely in HTML. Originally a designer, Chris graduated from the University of Redlands, Johnston Center. He left with a self-made degree titled Creative Arts in the Digital Revolution, which combined his loves for music, visual art, film and writing using computers as a medium for all of them.</p>\n<p>As a freelance designer and developer, Chris has built WordPress-powered sites for criminal lawyers, schools, independent musicians and tabletop game designers. These days, nothing makes him happier than finding new ways to do cool stuff with WordPress. Chris is an author for the online developer training provider, <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Authors/Details/chris-reynolds">Pluralsight</a>, and has been involved with <a href="http://2013.slc.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Salt Lake City</a> in some form or another since 2011.</p>\n<p>If Chris isn&#8217;t sitting in front of his computer, he might be found playing Magic: the Gathering, camping in southern Utah or cheering for his local Major League Soccer team, Real Salt Lake.

After high school, he decided to leave the Jersey Shore for the University of Miami, pursuing a degree in Architecture. It was at this time he began to learn more about design principles, and was fascinated about emerging technologies like AutoCad, Photoshop, 3D Studio Max, Flash and the web.</p>\n<p>After graduating early from the U in 2005, he worked in the architectural profession for several years before transitioning to web design and development with WordPress full time in 2010. He was drawn to WordPress because of the awesome community and the amazing flexibility of the software.

Shawn&#8217;s experience with WordPress ranges from small sites for local businesses trying to break into the e-commerce realm to large multi-site real estate installations with dozens of unique, interactive floor-plans. WordPress is his favorite platform to work with because of its powerful potential right out-of-the-box. When a skilled developer can spend less time on core functionality and more into the custom side, you have a truly unique and awe-inspiring website.</span></p>\n<p><span style="color: #808080">During his free time, he&#8217;s usually found at the gym, mountain biking or catching up with friends. Over the past few years fitness has become an important part of his life; having lost a large amount of fat and transforming his life, eating habits and views on exercise. Shawn greatly enjoys riding his bike through Piedmont Park in Atlanta, GA.  Disconnecting from the technology world helps remind him of the simple things in life we often overlook.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style="color: #222222"><span style="color: #808080">I&#8217;m extremely excited to be a part of the WDS team!  Having read and studied many of the books written by the guru&#8217;s of WordPress here at WDS;  I truly look forward to working with this genius team, learning new tips &amp; tricks and mastering the platform.  I feel the potential for myself and my team is limitless with WDS and am eager to see what the future may hold!</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style="color: #222222"><span style="color: #808080">We are very excited to see what Shawn will offer to the WDS brain!

Which he then took apart and put back together, after trying to connect to the then, new, internet. Once he graduated high school, Jay moved out of his parents house to the lower apartment, bought his own computer, and a book, PHP for Dummies. </span></p>\n<p><span style="color: #808080">He began learning PHP and playing around with it off and on.  Never really getting serious for awhile until he read about MySQL and he thought, “how cool would it be to save information?”  So then began the two year journey on learning PHP and MySQL integration. Over the next few years Jay refined his PHP skills and started looking into multiple CMS systems.  Joomla was his first, followed by Drupal, and then WordPress.  He has stuck with WordPress ever since and in his down-time he reads the documentation just for fun.</span></p>\n<p><span style="color: #808080">During his off time, Jay is a gamer and plugin hobbyist of sorts.  He loves trying to integrate WordPress with other API&#8217;s when he can.  Bascially, he likes pushing WordPress to it&#8217;s limit, and break it when possible.  When he&#8217;s not working with code, Jay is managing a Minecraft server for friends and learning Laravel 4 as a side project.  He loves learning new things and takes the chance when he can.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style="color: #808080">I&#8217;m excited to leave the freelance scene behind me and work with a team. Working for myself, by myself, for two years had grown tiresome and frustrating to find new clients.  Working with WDS, I&#8217;ll get to have the workload I want, along with the guaranteed paycheck I need.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style="color: #808080">We are excited to see what Jay will offer to WDS and don&#8217;t forget, you can follow him on</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/plugish">Twitter</a>!</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"http://webdevstudios.com/2014/06/10/wds-welcomes-jay-wood/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:54:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"WDS Welcomes Zack Rothauser!";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"http://webdevstudios.com/2014/06/09/wds-welcomes-zack-rothauser/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://webdevstudios.com/2014/06/09/wds-welcomes-zack-rothauser/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 09 Jun 2014 15:35:07 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"Community";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"General";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Team";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Twitter";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"http://webdevstudios.com/?p=8218";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:417:"WebDevStudios is proud to announce one of our newest Front-End developers, Zack Rothauser!

If you tried to use it, your draft would disappear and it wouldn&#8217;t save. While we doubt anyone was writing a novella using this tool, <em>any</em> loss of content is unacceptable to us.</p>\n<p>We recognize how much trust you place in us to safeguard your content, and we take this responsibility very seriously. We&#8217;re sorry we let you down.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve all lost words we&#8217;ve written before, like an email thanks to a cat on the keyboard or a term paper to a blue screen of death. Over the last few WordPress releases, we&#8217;ve made a number of improvements to features like autosaves and revisions. With revisions, an old edit can always be restored. We&#8217;re trying our hardest to save your content somewhere even if your power goes out or your browser crashes. We even monitor your internet connection and prevent you from hitting that &#8220;Publish&#8221; button at the exact moment the coffee shop Wi-Fi has a hiccup.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s <em>possible</em> that the quick draft you lost last week is still in the database, and just hidden from view. As an added complication, these &#8220;discarded drafts&#8221; normally get deleted after seven days, and it&#8217;s already been six days since the release.

They have just launched their newly designed website (<em>note to early readers</em>: it&#8217;s in process of launching at this moment, so some links may not work until later today) to reflect some of the ways they&#8217;ve changed over the years. They are also growing, rapidly.</p>\n<p>The new website is a complete rebrand. They&#8217;ve tweaked their logo many times over the years, but they&#8217;ve completely changed it now. It&#8217;s much more modern and can be used in a variety of ways.</p>\n<p>The new website is flat, geometric, modern, and as sassy as ever (like with their <a href="https://pagely.com/about-us/investors/">Investors page</a> they are quite proud of). In all, the redesign attempts to showcase happy customers and what makes them different.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.poststat.us/pagely-growth-wordpress-hosting/pagely-new-homepage/" rel="attachment wp-att-7181"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7181" src="http://www.poststat.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/pagely-new-homepage-752x547.png" alt="pagely-new-homepage" width="627" height="456" /></a></p>\n<p>They are introducing <a href="https://pagely.com/ambassadors/">brand ambassadors</a> &#8212; a kind of super testimonial &#8212; that includes names you&#8217;ll surely recognize from the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>Additionally, they are giving other managed hosts a bit of a sting with what they call <a href="https://pagely.com/turnthepage/">#turnthepage</a>, a dedicated page to highlight that they don&#8217;t charge for pageviews, something that most managed WordPress hosting companies do.<span id="more-7174"></span></p>\n<p>Pagely has implemented the new branding and design elements across most of their platform, including their Support sub-site.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7176" src="http://www.poststat.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/support-pagely-752x491.png" alt="support-pagely" width="627" height="409" /></p>\n<p>In addition to branding and a web redesign, Pagely is attempting to showcase that they were first to market with managed WordPress hosting, but also that they are best in class. The strategy &#8212; and particularly their recent all-in <a title="Pagely has new plans, a new dashboard, and a new Amazon Web Services infrastructure" href="http://www.poststat.us/pagely-wordpress-hosting-amazon/">move to being an AWS-based service</a> &#8212; appear to be working.</p>\n<h3>Record growth</h3>\n<p>I discussed the Pagely redesign and their recent growth with Joshua Strebel, Pagely co-founder and CEO. He told me that they&#8217;ve seen an enormous amount of growth this year.</p>\n<p>Revenue is up 28% in the last month alone and between 40-45% quarter over quarter. This means that Pagely is on pace to more than double in size between this summer and next.</p>\n<p>To some this may seem a surprise, but it&#8217;s part of some slow and steady investments Pagely has made in recent years.</p>\n<p>They certainly did not scale at the pace of other players in the market &#8212; most notably <a href="http://wpengine.com">WP Engine</a>. They also (as noted above with the Investors page) have bootstrapped their company from the beginning.</p>\n<p>Noone knows exactly how big Pagely is today, and that&#8217;s part of what you get with their owners. Though I&#8217;m told they are &#8220;more than 10 people but fewer than 50.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6550" src="http://www.poststat.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/pagely-team-752x378.jpg" alt="pagely-team" width="627" height="315" /></p>\n<p>The Strebel&#8217;s (on the left of the picture above) own the company &#8212; only sharing equity with some key employees &#8212; and they are proud of their independence.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s nearly impossible to be a Pagely customer without feeling the presence of Josh and Sally Strebel&#8217;s own personalities. And while Josh is an opinionated figure in the WordPress community, Pagely customers seem quite happy with that.</p>\n<h3>Managed host customer satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Steven Gliebe started a new project recently called <a href="http://hostingreviews.io/">HostingReviews.io</a>, a website that attempts to collect non-biased reviews from social media about various hosting solutions. Pagely has a 94% happiness rating according to HostingReviews.io &#8212; matched only by <a href="http://getflywheel.com">Flywheel&#8217;s</a> 95% rating.</p>\n<p>I like Steven&#8217;s project because he is not using affiliates at all with this project, an aspect that spoils most hosting review websites. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of some others:</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.poststat.us/pagely-growth-wordpress-hosting/hosting-reviews-io/" rel="attachment wp-att-7175"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7175" src="http://www.poststat.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/hosting-reviews-io-752x757.png" alt="hosting-reviews-io" width="627" height="631" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Changes in managed WordPress hosting markets</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s been an interesting time to analyze the managed WordPress hosting market. For one, the term &#8220;managed WordPress hosting&#8221; is here to stay. Nearly every large player &#8212; including the likes of GoDaddy, Bluehost, Dreamhost, and more &#8212; offer a managed WordPress hosting product.</p>\n<p>The differences between these large company products and the original smaller players &#8212; players like Pagely, WP Engine, Pressable, and later entrants like Flywheel, Siteground, and Pantheon &#8212; are beyond the name of the product. You really have to dig into each service and business model to get a full grasp of how they are unique.</p>\n<p>And this is really hard.</p>\n<p>For one, you can find positive and negative things about every host in the world. But also, these companies are often targeting different audiences. For instance, GoDaddy and the other large hosts pretty clearly want the smaller website audience, but to upsell them with a more WordPress-specific package. And that&#8217;s fine; they can offer some great functionality for that.</p>\n<p>But Pagely, Pantheon, and some others are going after bigger fish; and they are marketing themselves appropriately.</p>\n<h3>Going after WordPress.com VIP</h3>\n<p><a href="http://vip.wordpress.com/">WordPress.com VIP</a> is the king of the big-WordPress mountain. They have the promise of infinite scale and excellent reliability. It&#8217;s Automattic&#8217;s own product and an excellent business model for them.</p>\n<p>They are able to charge big companies big dollars (relative to other WordPress hosting, not compared to some enterprise software these companies are used to) to get the assurance that their website is hosted safely and reliably.</p>\n<p>WordPress.com <a href="http://vip.wordpress.com/stats/">serves billions of pageviews every month</a>. It&#8217;s simply a massive platform and a comfortable place for companies to take their WordPress hosting needs.</p>\n<p>Pagely wants to be an alternative to WordPress.com VIP. They see themselves as a viable and attractive alternative. For one, they&#8217;ll tell you that you can run anything on Pagely; whereas WordPress VIP has a restricted ecosystem that involves approved-only plugins and stringent code reviews for any custom code, that often requires one of their VIP service partners to perform the work.</p>\n<blockquote><p>VIP is a great service. However it is no longer the only service capable of serving clients at scale. We are winning more of those high-caliber clients that need the extra flexibility our stack offers.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Joshua Strebel, Pagely CEO</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pagely and others seeking the high end market are still relatively early on in their efforts; WordPress.com VIP is a behemoth in that market.</p>\n<h3>A changing tide</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve noticed &#8212; and I&#8217;m sure some of you have too &#8212; a change in tide of WordPress managed hosting. This year has no doubt been a very tough one for some managed hosts.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been painful to see customers that were once happy with their service &#8212; to the point of being huge brand ambassadors themselves &#8212; to quietly leaving and moving on to something else, now with warranted skepticism.</p>\n<p>Personally, I try to stay pretty host-agnostic. It is a very difficult market to say anything about, due to its incredibly competitive nature. However, I think it&#8217;s obvious that Pagely &#8212; accompanied by the likes of <a href="http://siteground.com">SiteGround</a> and <a href="http://getpantheon.com">Pantheon</a> &#8212; is on the rise while some of the other early entrants to WordPress managed hosting are struggling to consistently deliver on their promises.</p>\n<p>However, with new-found popularity and fast growth, Pagely too can be susceptible to some of the same growing pains of their competition.

And they assure me that they have been hiring some of the best support techs and engineers in the business.

Situated on the University of Michigan campus at the <a title="http://uunions.umich.edu/league/" href="http://uunions.umich.edu/league/">Michigan League</a>, nearly 150 people from all walks of life gathered to learn about WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Beginner&#8217;s Guide to WordCamps</h2>\n<p>I started the day with a session by <a title="http://serverpress.com/" href="http://serverpress.com/">Marc Benzakein</a> entitled &#8220;<a title="http://2014.annarbor.wordcamp.org/session/how-to-rock-a-wordcamp-even-if-youre-a-total-noob/" href="http://2014.annarbor.wordcamp.org/session/how-to-rock-a-wordcamp-even-if-youre-a-total-noob/">How to Rock a WordCamp Even if You’re a Total n00b</a>.&#8221; When Benzakein asked how many in the room were attending their first WordCamp, the majority raised their hands. After attending more than a dozen WordCamps, Benzakein offers advice to first-time attendees and explains how to get the most out of the event.</p>\n<a href="http://wptavern.com/my-experience-at-wordcamp-ann-arbor-2014#gallery-31846-1-slideshow">Click to view slideshow.</a>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to see more WordCamps incorporate the same or a similar session at the beginning of the event, especially if it&#8217;s the first one for the area. It breaks the ice and gives attendees a realistic expectation of what a WordCamp is all about. Those who attended the presentation had the opportunity to meet Benzakein&#8217;s son, Eli.</p>\n<p>His son contributed to the conversation and helped break the ice with his humorous questions and commentary. He contributed so much that if he <del>registers an account on WordPress.org</del>, I&#8217;d like to see the speakers badge added to <a title="https://profiles.wordpress.org/Elijahbenzak" href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/Elijahbenzak">his profile</a>. If you&#8217;d like more information on how to survive your first WordCamp, Carrie Dils has an excellent <a title="http://www.carriedils.com/wordcamp-tips/" href="http://www.carriedils.com/wordcamp-tips/">survival guide</a> available.</p>\n<h2> Child Themes and Theme Frameworks</h2>\n<p>Next up, I sat in on <a title="http://philhoyt.com/" href="http://philhoyt.com/">Phil Hoyt&#8217;s</a> presentation on using <a title="http://2014.annarbor.wordcamp.org/session/using-frameworks-and-child-themes/" href="http://2014.annarbor.wordcamp.org/session/using-frameworks-and-child-themes/">Frameworks and Child Themes</a>. He described the benefits of what a theme framework offers and the proper way of editing themes via child themes. His theme framework is called <a title="https://wordpress.org/themes/generic-framework" href="https://wordpress.org/themes/generic-framework">Generic</a> and is available for free on the WordPress Theme Directory.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/156.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[31846]"><img class="size-large wp-image-31860" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/156.jpg?resize=500%2C375" alt="Child Themes and Theme Frameworks" /></a>Learning about Child Themes and Theme Frameworks\n<h2>Be The Peacock</h2>\n<p>My favorite session of the day was &#8220;<a class="wcpt-session-title" href="http://2014.annarbor.wordcamp.org/session/be-the-peacock-creating-and-loving-your-online-brand/">Be the Peacock: Creating and Loving Your Online Brand</a>&#8221; by <a title="http://www.web-savvy-marketing.com/" href="http://www.web-savvy-marketing.com/">Rebecca Gill</a>. The idea behind her presentation is that a peacock has beautiful, vibrant colors, and is not afraid to strut them. Likewise, individuals need to stand out and make themselves and their brand distinguishable. In the presentation, she tells the story of how she was once a shy individual, afraid to strut her colors and diagnosed with <a title="http://wordpress.tv/2014/02/14/chris-lema-escaping-the-impostor-syndrome/" href="http://wordpress.tv/2014/02/14/chris-lema-escaping-the-impostor-syndrome/">Imposter Syndrome</a>. After receiving a pep talk from <a title="http://chrislema.com/" href="http://chrislema.com/">Chris Lema</a>, she embraced her inner peacock.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/157.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[31846]"><img class="size-large wp-image-31862" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/157.jpg?resize=500%2C375" alt="Be The Peacock Not The Peahen" /></a>Be The Peacock Not The Peahen\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Wise Words From a Mentor</h2>\n<p>When <a title="http://3.7designs.co/" href="http://3.7designs.co/">Ross Johnson</a> put the wheels in motion to organize WordCamp Ann Arbor, he didn&#8217;t have a reference level of interest. Although the Ann Arbor area has a <a title="http://www.meetup.com/WordPress-Ann-Arbor/" href="http://www.meetup.com/WordPress-Ann-Arbor/">monthly meetup group</a> with 40-50 rotating attendees, he didn&#8217;t know if people would feel compelled to travel from Detroit. Because of the uncertainty, attendance for the event was capped at 150 tickets. &#8220;We ended up selling out early and having nearly seventy people on the waiting list. We of course had made all of our accommodations based on 150 people,&#8221; Johnson told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>John Hawkins who organized WordCamp Las Vegas 2013 and is putting together <a title="http://2014.vegas.wordcamp.org/" href="http://2014.vegas.wordcamp.org/">the event for 2014</a> mentored Johnson along with a few other first-time organizers. Hawkins suggested to Johnson that he should release more tickets and that 10-15% of people wouldn&#8217;t show up. &#8220;As predicted, a large group of people didn&#8217;t show up and we were able to accommodate everyone without issue.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Finding a Venue</h2>\n<p>Finding a venue can be one of the more challenging aspects of organizing a WordCamp. Most speakers appreciate being able to walk to the venue from their hotel room. After ruling out corporate venues due to cost, Johnson was left to choose between donated office space, public space, or the University of Michigan.</p>\n<p><a title="http://www.lyndsayjohnson.com/" href="http://www.lyndsayjohnson.com/">Lyndsay Johnson</a> who studied at the University recommended that he try contacting the <a title="http://uunions.umich.edu/league/" href="http://uunions.umich.edu/league/">Michigan League</a> event services department. &#8220;After touring the facilities we knew it was the spot we wanted to try. It was central to downtown and had an incredible classic vibe to it which brought an interesting contrast for a tech event.&#8221; Another benefit to using the League is the on site catering as well as a strong technology team to help keep technical hiccups to a minimum.</p>\n<h2>Lessons Learned From a First Timer</h2>\n<p>Johnson recommends that organizers start early. While WordCamp Ann Arbor took place on October 14th, he sent out the first email related to the event in early February. &#8220;On paper it doesn&#8217;t look like there is <i>that</i> match to do, but it&#8217;s more than it seems.&#8221; Second and third time organizers have the luxury of building off of previous experience. That&#8217;s a luxury first timers don&#8217;t have. &#8220;When starting from scratch you have to design a new website, new badges, new logo, etc.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of the most important aspects of managing a large event such as a WordCamp is the team surrounding you. &#8220;Get a group of organizers that you can really trust and don&#8217;t be afraid to delegate to them.&#8221; In addition to Johnson, the organizing team includes: Justin Ferriman, Kloe Ferriman, Rebecca Gill, Lyndsay Johnson, Kyle Maurer, and Declan O&#8217;Neill. Despite having help, Johnson feels as though he took on too much work and will do a better job next year of asking for help.</p>\n<h2>Will There be a WordCamp Ann Arbor 2015?</h2>\n<p>Johnson tells me that they&#8217;ll likely have a second WordCamp in Ann Arbor next year and planning will begin sometime in February or earlier.</p>\n<h2>Can&#8217;t Wait For Round Two</h2>\n<p>For a first time event, WordCamp Ann Arbor didn&#8217;t experience many hiccups. The WiFi speeds at the League were fantastic with a consistent 20Mb up and down throughout the day. Attendees had to fend for themselves at lunch, but the setup offered an opportunity to exercise with a short walk to main street. Downtown Ann Arbor is filled with great places to eat but many of the locations are small, not being able to handle 10 or more people per table.</p>\n<p>With only 150 attendees, the atmosphere was relaxed and there was ample opportunity to meet each other. Attending WordCamp Ann Arbor reaffirms my feeling of enjoying smaller WordCamps versus those with 300 or more attendees. Last but not least, the University of Michigan is a beautiful campus, especially this time of year. If you live in or around the Ann Arbor area, keep tabs on the <a title="http://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/" href="http://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/">WordCamp Central schedule</a> and consider attending WordCamp in 2015.</p>\n<a href="http://wptavern.com/my-experience-at-wordcamp-ann-arbor-2014#gallery-31846-2-slideshow">Click to view slideshow.</a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 08 Oct 2014 19:32:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"Lorelle on WP: WordPress and Blogging Workshop in Forest Grove, Oregon";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/?p=11958";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:95:"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2014/10/07/wordpress-and-blogging-workshop-in-forest-grove-oregon/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:458:"On Friday, October 10, 2014, from 1-5PM I will be presenting a WordPress and Blogging Workshop in Forest Grove, Oregon, at the Forest Grove Senior and Community Center as a fundraiser for the center and part of the Writers in the Grove group.

According to the <a title="http://webdevstudios.com/2014/10/07/webdevstudios-acquires-maintainn-to-bring-wordpress-support-and-maintenance-services-in-house/" href="http://webdevstudios.com/2014/10/07/webdevstudios-acquires-maintainn-to-bring-wordpress-support-and-maintenance-services-in-house/">announcement</a>, the acquisition enables WebDevStudios to provide better maintenance and support to clients. Founded in 2012 by <a title="https://maintainn.com/team/shayne-sanderson/" href="https://maintainn.com/team/shayne-sanderson/">Shayne Sanderson</a>, Maintainn provides maintenance services including 24/7 security monitoring, daily off-site backups, weekly updates to WordPress core, themes and plugins, a dedicated WordPress support desk and custom development.</p>\n<p>Sanderson, once an employee for WebDevStudios as a Technical Project Manager, <a title="http://shaynesanderson.com/2013/11/15/on-the-road-again/" href="http://shaynesanderson.com/2013/11/15/on-the-road-again/">left the company in late 2013</a> to work on Maintainn full-time. What started as an individual endeavor, turned into a five person company.</p>\n<h2>The Retainer Arm of WebDevStudios</h2>\n<p>On paper, the acquisition makes sense. WebDevStudios is able to focus on attracting new clients knowing they have a foundation in place to offer support and maintenance packages to new and existing clients. Maintainn is essentially the retainer arm of WebDevStudios. Retainers are defined as, &#8220;a fee paid in advance to someone, especially an attorney, in order to secure or keep their services when required.&#8221; When applying the definition to development agencies, it&#8217;s not hard to see why most have a retainer program in place.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard, who works for WordPress design and development company <a title="http://ran.ge/" href="http://ran.ge/">Range</a>, explains why retainers can be an important part of an agency&#8217;s business model.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Retainers can be an excellent business tool for financing growth and forming long-term client relationships. Retainers offer consistent, reliable income that makes financing new hires less scary. They also allow the firm to really get to know the client and their needs over time, versus being limited to a single project scope. An existing retainer also puts the firm in great position to get lump sum projects from the client when those opportunities come up.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Not only do clients receive maintenance and support for WordPress, they also have access to a great team of developers. This gives WebDevStudios a competitive edge against companies such as <a title="http://www.wpsitecare.com/" href="http://www.wpsitecare.com/">WP Site Care</a>, <a title="http://wpcurve.com/" href="http://wpcurve.com/">WP Curve</a>, and <a title="http://wpmaintainer.com" href="http://wpmaintainer.com">WP Maintainer</a> that mostly focus mostly on maintenance and support.</p>\n<h2>MattReport Interview With Both Parties</h2>\n<p>I encourage you to read <a title="http://mattreport.com/webdevstudios-acquires-maintainn/" href="http://mattreport.com/webdevstudios-acquires-maintainn/">this interview</a> published on MattReport.com containing insight from both parties involved in the deal.

Having worked with and used several different eCommerce platforms (both hosted and self-hosted), I&#8217;ve definitely developed the mindset that there are use cases for each. WordPress can be the right choice in a lot of circumstances, but not all.</p>\n<h3>Hosted vs. self-hosted</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not sure about the major differences between hosted vs self hosted platforms, I recommend reading <em>Patrick Rauland&#8217;s</em> <a href="http://speakinginbytes.com/2014/08/hosted-vs-self-hosted-e-commerce/">overview of the major differences</a>. WordPress eCommerce usually falls under self-hosted eCommerce (I don&#8217;t count WordPress.com since it uses external eCommerce solutions). Forbes also <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/allbusiness/2014/09/26/which-e-commerce-platform-is-the-best-choice-for-your-online-store/">recently wrote about this</a>, though I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with their conclusions.</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://www.practicalecommerce.com/articles/70101-When-to-Avoid-WordPress-Ecommerce">typical viewpoint</a> is that WordPress plugins like WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads are great for small stores or people that just want to quickly and easily sell a few items, while hosted platforms like Shopify and Bigcommerce are for &#8220;serious&#8221; stores.</p>\n<p>This viewpoint is actually pretty backwards, not to mention the fact that the number of items is a poor way of determining which platform you should use.</p>\n<h3 id="give-each-its-due">Give each its due</h3>\n<p>Is WordPress the best platform on which to build apps? I don&#8217;t always think so, but it <strong>could be</strong>. Is it always a good choice for eCommerce? Nope. However, it&#8217;s the <strong>right one</strong> for lots of stores, and it&#8217;s the <strong>wrong one</strong> for lots of stores.</p>\n<p>There are a few major strengths and weaknesses of both WordPress and hosted solutions. I&#8217;ve worked most with <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/">WooCommerce</a>, <a href="http://easydigitaldownloads.com/">Easy Digital Downloads</a>, and <a href="http://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a>, but have tried lots of other eCommerce solutions for comparison. Some of the knocks against WordPress aren&#8217;t valid, but we should note that some are.</p>\n<h3>WordPress eCommerce weaknesses</h3>\n<p>Everyone loves to talk about how easy certain WordPress plugins are to use. When you compare WordPress plugins to something like Shopify, this just <strong>isn&#8217;t true</strong>. They may be easy to use for people that are familiar with WordPress, but not for the average user who wants to start selling online with no experience.</p>\n<p>WordPress requires a domain name purchase, hosting setup, installation, plugin installation and setup, theme installation and setup, blah blah blah, you get the drift. With hosted solutions, you don&#8217;t worry about this (though solutions like <a href="http://evermo.re/">Evermore</a> &#8212; which was <a title="Evermore, hosted WordPress with power and ease of use" href="http://www.poststat.us/evermore-interview/">covered by Post Status</a> when it launched &#8212; make this interesting). You pay your monthly bill, and you&#8217;re handed a store website &#8211; you just pick the name and get rolling. You can start adding products right away, and then you might get into changing your theme or other setup.<span id="more-7165"></span></p>\n<div id="attachment_7167" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-7167 size-medium" src="http://www.poststat.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/easy-300x258.jpg" alt="easy" width="300" height="258" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3181/3086827283_e9e762331c.jpg">Image Credit</a></p></div>\n<p>Some of the site tweaks or setup with hosted solutions aren&#8217;t easy, but the learning curve for a solution like Shopify is far gentler than the learning curve for something like WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>There are also <strong>WP Cron</strong> issues for some sites, as it&#8217;s not a perfect system for scheduling actions, like recurring payments. It can work pretty well, but other platforms can make this far easier to implement and more reliable than Cron.</p>\n<p>WordPress store owners are also <strong>responsible</strong> for their own hosting, software updates, and security. For many site owners, these are huge responsibilities. Hosted solutions roll all of this into their package so that users don&#8217;t have to know how their website is powered. They just have to use it.</p>\n<p>Both WordPress and hosted solutions will scale, but there are considerations with WordPress that users need to be aware of. Database issues (like backups or memory with massive amounts of customers and orders) should be addressed, hosting has to be optimized, and plugins need to scale with the site. With a hosted solution, none of this is your problem as a user.</p>\n<h3>WordPress eCommerce strengths</h3>\n<p>Bearing these weaknesses in mind, it&#8217;s a bit crazy to me that WordPress is sometimes referred to as the &#8220;easy solution&#8221; or the right tool for &#8220;small stores&#8221;. It&#8217;s not. In many cases, it&#8217;s like bringing a tank to the eCommerce playground.</p>\n<p>So what does WordPress do well?</p>\n<p>First, WordPress offers the most all-in-one website solution available. WordPress can offer the eCommerce aspects of the website, in addition to its many other CMS features. The ability to create a single, seamless CMS experience for a multi-purpose website makes it quite compelling and more budget-friendly than more &#8220;eCommerce first&#8221; platforms.</p>\n<p>Second, it&#8217;s optimized for <strong>SEO</strong>. Your content is crucial here, and WordPress is built for content. More importantly, if you&#8217;ve tried to blog on another platform, you know how painful it can be (don&#8217;t start with me Squarespace fans, that thing is difficult to use). WordPress doesn&#8217;t encourage you to avoid blogging to avoid headache: it&#8217;s built for <strong>complete websites</strong>, and is not simply focused on eCommerce.</p>\n<p>WordPress also contains functionality that you can&#8217;t always get with different platforms. There&#8217;s a massive selection of plugins, themes, and all sorts of solutions for WordPress that are readily available. Since it&#8217;s open source, it&#8217;s far easier to find ways to customize it when compared to closed platforms like Bigcommerce.</p>\n<p>Speaking of customizations, your ability to customize WordPress or plugins is <strong>far</strong> easier than with hosted solutions. There&#8217;s lots of functionality that can be achieved with WordPress that&#8217;s not even possible in hosted solutions. For example, developers have no control over the Shopify checkout process, but this can be entirely customized with WordPress.</p>\n<p>You can also usually find a plugin that will provide a &#8220;starting point&#8221; for a customization project. Even if you find a Shopify or Bigcommerce app that gets <em>close</em> to what you need, but not quite, you&#8217;ll need to create a completely custom solution anyway &#8211; there&#8217;s no &#8220;extending&#8221; there.</p>\n<p>Along with customization is the <strong>control over your environment</strong>. You can spin up your eCommerce site on something like Digital Ocean, and you&#8217;ve got control over the entire site, from server to theme.</p>\n<h3>Product type</h3>\n<p>The biggest difference for me between hosted solutions and self-hosted actually isn&#8217;t usability or scalability &#8211; it&#8217;s <strong>product type</strong>. Can almost every eCommerce platform sell tee shirts? Yes. Even EDD can do that, and it&#8217;s made for digital products.</p>\n<p>However, selling complex products becomes infinitely more difficult on hosted platforms, as you&#8217;re restricted to what the API offers for product changes, which isn&#8217;t always a lot. For example, if you&#8217;ve ever tried to add pricing changes for customization options in Shopify, you know that it literally takes some wizardry, black magic, and possibly bubble gum used as tape to do so.</p>\n<p>WordPress plugins make this far easier, because the entire platform is open, not just an API. Most eCommerce plugins have more than enough actions or filters to change products, product pages, checkout forms, or any other part of your site.</p>\n<h3>Recap</h3>\n<p>Hosted eCommerce solutions are typically easy to use, and can provide some customization options via apps or other add-on services. However, it&#8217;s like renting a house versus owning. With a rented house, you can&#8217;t go knocking down walls or completely remodeling &#8211; you&#8217;ve got to work inside of a framework you&#8217;re given. This is exactly how a hosted solution works.</p>\n<p>The benefit to this is that you absolve yourself of a lot of responsibility and worry. The entire experience is managed and supported, and is typically very easy to work with.</p>\n<p>However, WordPress eCommerce is like buying the house. You can do whatever you want &#8211; add-on, rebuild sections of the house, change layouts around, add tunnels to other houses, you name it. However, when the water heater blows up, it&#8217;s your responsibility.</p>\n<p>WordPress also affords the opportunity to sell complex products, such as measurement based products like corks by the pound, that simply can&#8217;t be sold on other platforms. The same ability to customize WordPress so thoroughly lets you customize the eCommerce plugin you&#8217;re using.</p>\n<p>You gain the flexibility that comes with the platform, as well as the benefits like tons of plugins, themes, a great content structure, and a consistently maintained and updated core solution. However, the Frankenstein site that you build is your baby, and yours alone &#8211; you need to host it, maintain it, and care for it.</p>\n<p>WordPress lets you create advanced functionality via plugins and customizations, but isn&#8217;t right for users looking for an easy, basic shop setup. If you want a move-in ready house or a beautiful rental, you should look at hosted solutions. If you&#8217;re willing to make your dream house from great bones and foundation, or you need to sell fairly complex products, then WordPress might be it for you. It&#8217;s not the &#8220;easy&#8221; solution, but it can be a great one.</p>\n<div id="single-hcard-beka" class="loop-meta vcard"><h4 class="author-bio fn n">Beka Rice</h4><div class="author-description"><img alt="Beka Rice" src="http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/5ea957b08d0cf6a1e5e5cf5681519537?s=150&d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D150&r=G" class="avatar avatar-150 photo" height="150" width="150" /><div class="user-bio author-bio">Beka is the content manager for <a href="http://skyverge.com">SkyVerge</a>, where she writes sales copy, documentation, and website content.

Friends know I like doing personal experiments just to question assumptions or ingrained behavior, other examples this I&#8217;ve tried this year are giving up drinking for a month, going without a smartphone for 40 days, and more recently training for a half marathon with my friend Rene. I thought blogging every day would be a burden, but it actually became a great source of joy. It was more a shift in mindset than anything &#8212; every day I read things I think are interesting, share links with friends, have thoughts that are 80% of a blog post, and write a ton privately, it was just a matter of catching those moments and turning them into something that was shared with the world.</p>\n<p>The tools besides WordPress that I found super-helpful in this were <a href="http://simplenote.com/">Simplenote</a>, which was great for capturing thoughts and drafts when I was on the go, and I&#8217;ve been using the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/editorial-calendar/">Editorial Calendar</a> plugin to help me schedule drafts and keep an eye on my progress. The Editorial Calendar plugin is useful but I don&#8217;t love it &#8212; I wish the calendar view moved week by week rather than replacing the whole table, that it was responsive or worked on mobile, and that it would take over your publish button so you could define a desired posting cadence (in my case every 24 hours) and it would put a finished post in the next free slot, or let you bump something to the front of the queue and push all the other posts back a day. There were a few missteps along the way with timezones but overall I&#8217;m happy with how the experiment turned out.</p>\n<p>So what broke the streak? It was actually one of the other experiments: running. I&#8217;ve never considered myself a runner, and never really done it in my life, but a few months ago I started trying it and have been training up for a half marathon on November 16. (<a href="http://ma.tt/2014/10/photo-run-through-stockholm/">It&#8217;s also a great opportunity to take photos</a>.) Yesterday morning I woke up early around 5 AM and as the sun started to come up, and the weather was so nice after <a href="https://cloudup.com/cCYGA3rqlvi">I rounded the Bay Bridge</a> (planned turnaround point) kept going to Crissy Field where <a href="https://cloudup.com/caWpo6oFQ0d">I saw the Golden Gate from afar</a> and thought it would be fun to cross it. <a href="http://matt.wordpress.com/2014/10/04/under-golden-gate/">After crossing</a> I was starving by and figured 3 more miles would be a half marathon and also put me in Sausalito. The last mile or two was really tough, definitely beyond what I was ready for and I walked a lot, but <a href="http://runkeeper.com/user/photomatt/activity/446743645?&activityList=false&tripIdBase36=7dz9lp&channel=web.activity.shorturl">I was very proud of the result</a>, finishing in around 2 hours 45 minutes. But I hadn&#8217;t planned to stay out that long, and the rest of my day was full of meetings. I had moved my scheduled post for the day out so I could talk about the new Childish Gambino mixtape (post coming tomorrow) but the rest of the day was so busy and I got exhausted so early I totally forgot to post.</p>\n<p>So achieved one life goal while breaking the streak on another, which is not ideal, but today is another day and I want to see if I can break the 39 day streak next. Everything happens one day at a time. <img src="http://i1.wp.com/s.ma.tt/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?w=604" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 04 Oct 2014 17:42:10 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Matt Mullenweg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"WPTavern: Contributing Back to WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=31765";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"http://wptavern.com/contributing-back-to-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9026:"<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/matt-mullenweg.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[31765]"><img class="size-full wp-image-31713" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/matt-mullenweg.jpg?resize=1024%2C522" alt="Photo by Vladimir Kaladan Petkov" /></a>Photo by Vladimir Kaladan Petkov\n<p>During a session at <a title="http://2014.europe.wordcamp.org/" href="http://2014.europe.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Europe</a>, Matt Mullenweg was asked how companies contribute back to WordPress, how they&#8217;re doing it, and what companies should do more of. He responded to the question in-depth in a blog post entitled <a title="http://ma.tt/2014/09/five-for-the-future/" href="http://ma.tt/2014/09/five-for-the-future/">Five for the Future</a>. In the post, he outlines 5% as being a good rule of thumb to avoid the <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of the commons</a>. The post ignited a healthy discussion throughout the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>While his post is more about WordPress organizations, companies, and agencies and how they can grow their part of the pie and WordPress as a whole, I&#8217;m going to focus on individual contributions.</p>\n<h2>What is a WordPress Contribution?</h2>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ContributionBox.png" rel="prettyphoto[31765]"><img class="size-full wp-image-31791" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ContributionBox.png?resize=640%2C213" alt="Contribution Box" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chrstopher/341538188/">Chrstopher</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>The definition of what classifies as a contribution to WordPress is subjective. In the broadest sense of the term, I define contribution as anything that furthers the WordPress project. I seperate contributions to WordPress into two groups, <strong>direct</strong> and <strong>indirect</strong>. Direct contributions are those that deal with the core of WordPress such as patches, leading a release, and commits. These have a direct impact on WordPress and the millions of people who use it.</p>\n<p>Indirect contributions are those that further the project without using code. Examples include meetups, WordCamps, and tech support. These are what I think make up the vast majority of contributions to WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Contributing to WordPress Without Realizing it</h2>\n<p>As I thought about the 5% goal and whether or not I meet the criteria, I had an epiphany. <em>Thousands of people likely contribute to WordPress everyday without realizing it</em>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A friend emails you and needs WordPress support. You help fix their problem.</li>\n<li>Someone needs a particular plugin to fulfill a need and you offer a suggestion that works.</li>\n<li>You&#8217;re at a local meetup and help someone figure out how to use a particular feature in WordPress.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of the examples above are <strong>indirect</strong> ways of contributing to WordPress but are things millions of people do everyday. In these moments, users are helping each other while in the background, they&#8217;re contributing to WordPress. This is important because it means a lot of individuals are probably closer to the 5% goal than they might realize.</p>\n<h2>The Impact of Contributions</h2>\n<p>One of the first comments to Mullenweg&#8217;s article is a question <a title="http://ma.tt/2014/09/five-for-the-future/#comment-578864" href="http://ma.tt/2014/09/five-for-the-future/#comment-578864">asked by bftrick</a>, &#8220;I like the idea of having a full-time employee that works on WordPress core but I think I’d rather have everyone on board and contributing 5% of their time. What do you think about that?&#8221; Mullenweg&#8217;s response is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Any percent that people can pitch in is fantastic! Some tasks divide into smaller pieces better than others, I’m sure over time you’ll find the balance that maximizes your impact. That actually brings up a good point, it’s good to look at what impact you’re having — I’ve seen companies dedicate a person full-time that hasn’t really had a big impact, and people working just a few hours a week that have had a big one. Look at the outcomes and results of what you contribute objectively, and if it’s not working try something different.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I find it fascinating that some companies devoting time and effort to work on WordPress can end up having little impact. Mullenweg&#8217;s comment is a good reminder to look at the impact your contributions are having.</p>\n<h2>The Value of Contributions</h2>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ValueOfContributions.png" rel="prettyphoto[31765]"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-31792 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ValueOfContributions.png?resize=641%2C222" alt="Value Of Contributions" /></a></p>\n<p>After years of being involved in the community, it&#8217;s my understanding that every contribution counts no matter how small it is. In December of 2013, I explained with the help of a few mentors, <a title="http://wptavern.com/i-contributed-to-the-core-of-wordpress-and-you-can-too" href="http://wptavern.com/i-contributed-to-the-core-of-wordpress-and-you-can-too">how I contributed to the core</a> of WordPress for the first time. I corrected a typo inside the default theme. I&#8217;d almost classify this as an indirect contribution but since it deals with the core of WordPress, I consider it a direct contribution. Due to the typo I fixed, my name was added to the credits page of WordPress 3.8.</p>\n<p>There are hundreds of ways for people to contribute to WordPress but few that receive public acknowledgement. This is one of the reasons why badges have been added to WordPress.org user profiles.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wordpress-profile.png" rel="prettyphoto[31765]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20468" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wordpress-profile.png?resize=1025%2C460" alt="wordpress-profile" /></a>If you&#8217;ve organized or have spoken at a WordCamp, which I classify as an indirect contribution, you&#8217;ll be publicly acknowledged with a badge.</p>\n<p>On the surface, all contributions to WordPress no matter how small appear to be valued equally. However, WordPress is code that is written and maintained by humans. If direct contributions from volunteers decline to nothing, all of the indirect contributions become a moot point. While I think writing about WordPress is definitely a worthy contribution to the project, the reality is, <em>code is what gets the job done</em>.</p>\n<h2>Contributing Back to WordPress Just Makes Sense</h2>\n<p>While Automattic makes a significant contribution to the WordPress project, I&#8217;d hate to see it become the <strong>only</strong> large contributor. Development of WordPress 4.1 is being <a title="http://wptavern.com/meet-john-blackbourn-wordpress-4-1-release-lead" href="http://wptavern.com/meet-john-blackbourn-wordpress-4-1-release-lead">lead by John Blackbourn</a>, who is employed by the agency, <a title="http://codeforthepeople.com/" href="http://codeforthepeople.com/">Code For The People</a>. It&#8217;s the second release in a row to be lead by an individual not employed by Audrey Capital or Automattic.

He offered a rule of thumb for companies that benefit from the software and want to invest in the future of WordPress:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think a good rule of thumb that will scale with the community as it continues to grow is that organizations that want to grow the WordPress pie (and not just their piece of it) <strong>should dedicate 5% of their people to working on something to do with core</strong> — be it development, documentation, security, support forums, theme reviews, training, testing, translation or whatever it might be that helps move WordPress mission forward.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He cites the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons" target="_blank">tragedy of the commons</a> as an example fate that he hopes WordPress can avoid.</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://ma.tt/2014/09/five-for-the-future/" target="_blank">5% statement</a> was instantly controversial, sparking a number of heated discussions on <a href="http://benmetcalfe.com/blog/2014/09/wordpress-what-exactly-do-they-get-for-their-5/" target="_blank">blogs</a>, <a href="http://www.poststat.us/contribution-culture/" target="_blank">news sites</a>, and Twitter. Some took exception to the wording of his suggestion, as the use of &#8220;should&#8221; implies a moral obligation, complicated further by the fact that the statement originates from a person in a position of power, who many perceive as the person most likely to benefit from increased contributions.</p>\n<p>Granted, Mullenweg is at the helm of what is undeniably the most successful WordPress-based company in operation. Automattic is one of many companies that are entirely reliant on this software for their continued existence. Though all may not benefit equally from contribution, it does not negate the fact that the WordPress project is 100% dependent on contribution and would not exist without it. If we want to see it grow, there must be continued contribution, and in the end it doesn&#8217;t matter if that motivation is practical or ideological.</p>\n<p>Open source businesses are free to act on Mullenweg&#8217;s suggestion of 5% contribution or to throw it out entirely. The issue cuts close to home. It&#8217;s a personal question of philosophy as much as it is a business consideration.</p>\n<p>For Mullenweg, the suggestion of a 5% contribution originates out of a desire to ensure the future of WordPress. The project started out much like your average garage band. Mullenweg <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/" target="_blank">wanted a place to blog and post photos</a>, so with the help of a handful of contributors, WordPress was born. Since the very early days, he has been unwavering when it comes to protecting user freedoms with the GPL and established the project&#8217;s mission to democratize publishing through open source software.</p>\n<p>Before you decide to contribute, it&#8217;s a good idea to consider the future of WordPress. Where does Matt see the project going? Do you want to be a part of taking it there? I had the opportunity to speak with him at WordCamp Europe to press further into his vision of WordPress for the next decade.</p>\n<h2>Mobile</h2>\n<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard it before: mobile is a big part of the future of WordPress. Mullenweg emphasizes this in nearly every recent interview I&#8217;ve read and Automattic is aggressively hiring mobile developers. For many internet users, their mobile device is the only way they access the web. This is particularly true for users in countries like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_mobile_phones_in_use" target="_blank">China and India</a>. If WordPress is to gain penetration in these geographical regions, it must provide a solid mobile experience.</p>\n<p>This puts the WordPress mobile apps in a singular place of influence, which results in a bit of controversy at the moment. Currently, the apps are packed full of WordPress.com features that provide functionality beyond the core publishing experience. Many self-hosted WordPress users <a href="http://wptavern.com/poll-who-uses-reader-in-the-wordpress-mobile-apps" target="_blank">find the Reader in particular to be irrelevant</a>.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg explained Automattic&#8217;s approach to the mobile apps:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The goal with the mobile apps is first and foremost to get as many mobile app users as possible, because I think that ensures WordPress development for years to come. They are open source projects and people can contribute code to make them do a lot of different things. The team is focused on developing the things that will be most compelling to people on the mobile side. That&#8217;s notifications, stats, and the reader.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Since the apps are open source, developers can fork them and remove unwanted features if they want to. However, this seems a bit counterintuitive for self-hosted WordPress users who don&#8217;t use WordPress.com features. The recent <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-publishes-first-ever-video-ad-entitled-welcome-home" target="_blank">video ad</a> produced by Automattic does not put the spotlight on the Reader but rather features the mobile apps in use for publishing media. Won&#8217;t people be using the publishing features more often than the Reader? Mullenweg doesn&#8217;t think so.</p>\n<blockquote><p>By definition, people read more than they write. You read far more than you write.  The average blogger doesn&#8217;t post every day. They read blogs every day. In fact, they read WordPress blogs every day, over a billion per month. By connecting more of those to the active users with this thing we call WordPress, I think it opens the door for more publishing in the future, which is really exciting.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The apps are technically open source. If there&#8217;s a strong contingency of developers who don&#8217;t agree with the preeminence of WordPress.com&#8217;s Reader in the app, they can work to change that through contribution. The reality is that mobile developers are few and far between. At the moment, Automattic drives nearly 100% of the contribution on the apps and its agenda is unrivaled. These apps wouldn&#8217;t exist without the company&#8217;s contributions.</p>\n<p>I asked Mullenweg if other contributing commercial entities are free to push their own features through the official mobile apps. &#8220;Yeah they could,&#8221; he said, but followed it up with more insight on what he believes to be Automattic&#8217;s role in the mobile apps:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think that in many ways, Automattic is a shepherd. When you type in WordPress into a search engine, we&#8217;re the thing that pops up first. We&#8217;re the gateway drug, the thing that brings in the billions of people who don&#8217;t use WordPress yet. That&#8217;s our responsibility.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He believes that, as more users easily gain access through WordPress.com, it will mean a greater number of those who transition to self-hosted sites, as people graduate from the service. &#8220;We&#8217;ll even help them move on,&#8221; he said. Obviously, you cannot simply download PHP files to your phone and get started.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We want you to be able to start a blog and engage with the world of blogging 100% from the mobile device,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That requires WordPress.com and Jetpack features. Will it forever? Maybe not, but, as an idealist in a practical world, while that is not what I&#8217;d choose as a perfect solution &#8211; I&#8217;d love for you to be able to run WordPress on your phone and the world could access it, but that&#8217;s not reality today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So why doesn&#8217;t Automattic simply rename the apps to reflect the fact that the it heavily features WordPress.com? &#8220;We could rename it to WordPress.com App, but then there would be no WordPress app.&#8221; Automattic only has 15 mobile engineers at present and there aren&#8217;t many on the outside lining up to contribute to the open source apps. For Mullenweg, the ease of starting a free blog via the app is something that will help to ensure the future of WordPress:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s difficult to build an open source thing on a closed source platform. I see it as a gateway drug and it gives people more options down the road. If we don&#8217;t do anything on mobile, five years from now, when everyone is only using mobile devices, they will all have Squarespace&#8217;s or Weebly&#8217;s. WordPress is still around but it just doesn&#8217;t matter. This allows us to matter five years from now.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mullenweg sees the apps as an easy onramp to the WordPress software in general, but recognizes that the method isn&#8217;t the most ideal situation for everyone. &#8220;The direction we&#8217;re moving is to make them more modular, so people can fork the apps more easily in the future,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you talk to anyone on the mobile team, you will find a passion for open source.&#8221; This means that there&#8217;s the potential for the focus of the app&#8217;s development to change in the future.</p>\n<h2>Internationalization and Global Adoption</h2>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/wp-croatia-serbia-slovenia-communities.png" rel="prettyphoto[31712]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/wp-croatia-serbia-slovenia-communities.png?resize=1025%2C509" alt="Croatian, Serbian and Slovenian WP communities with @photomatt @nacin at #WCEU - photo credit: Konstantin Tatar" class="size-full wp-image-31716" /></a>Croatian, Serbian and Slovenian WP communities with @photomatt @nacin at #WCEU &#8211; photo credit: Konstantin Tatar\n<p>WordCamp Europe is unique in that it brings together many WordPress users whose primary language is not English. Mullenweg could not hide his excitement about the recent and upcoming changes related to internationalization. &#8220;If WordPress is representative of the world, then English should be a minority of the interactions, contributions and even plugins,&#8221; he said, and remarked further on how we&#8217;re still in the old mindset of taking English plugins and themes and then translating them into another language.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Personally, I am far and away most excited about the internationalization improvements, because the fact that WordPress has that many users at all in these other languages where there&#8217;s not very much documentation, no plugins, very few themes, it&#8217;s kind of amazing. Basically we have lots of usage in other countries but it&#8217;s primarily built by English-speaking people. So when that starts to change to where you can, for example, login to your dashboard in Spanish, installation, plugins and themes in Spanish, I think it could substantially change WordPress&#8217; adoption rate.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He believes that internationalization improvements will be key to improving WordPress&#8217; global adoption and may perhaps be more of an influential factor than the software&#8217;s incremental improvement on features:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Honestly, incremental features in WordPress probably aren&#8217;t going to change its adoption rate (the number of people starting a WP blog every day). At this point, that&#8217;s primarily driven by our reputation and existing users. What will substantively change that is if WordPress opens up to vastly more audiences than it was before, be that platforms, languages, or cost. At the moment WordPress.com is free but it&#8217;s not fully available to all languages.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress already receives many contributions from contributors who do not speak English as their first language. Mullenweg believes it may be quite a ways down the road from now before WordPress core development requires translators to effectively incorporate contributions from what may someday be a larger contingency of non-English speaking lead developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Maybe there&#8217;s a full-time translator working with Nacin,&#8221; he commented, imagining how internationalization could change the project in the future. With WordPress fully opened up to more languages, the software has the potential to improve at an exponentially faster rate than it does now. It&#8217;s an exciting prospect to consider.</p>\n<h2>The Value of Experimentation</h2>\n<p>In his quest to ensure the future of WordPress, Mullenweg often looks outside of the project for inspiration. He&#8217;s devoted a team at Automattic to experimenting with non-WordPress technologies. This was the team that created the <a href="http://wptavern.com/automattics-planned-gravatar-app-morphs-into-a-selfies-app-for-android" target="_blank">Selfies app</a>, released earlier this year.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/selfies.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[31712]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/selfies.jpg?resize=582%2C267" alt="selfies" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26965" /></a></p>\n<p>The app wasn&#8217;t built on WordPress and didn&#8217;t appear to be as polished as other Automattic products. I asked Mullenweg why they chose to release the app in its unpolished state. He highlighted the importance of experimentation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One thing that&#8217;s difficult in a company, as it grows, is to not just work on the thing that&#8217;s most successful. WordPress, WordPress.com, Jetpack, these are ridiculously successful by any measure. It would be very easy for all 272 people at Automattic to only work on that. One of the things we did this year is create a team that is almost like our version of Google X, except we&#8217;re not going to space. As a smaller company our ambitions are a little more modest, but we do want that sense of experimentation, and that it&#8217;s ok to release something that&#8217;s not 100% polished.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This further clarifies the release of the Selfies app, which the team presented as an accident wherein the planned Gravatar App morphed into Selfies. &#8220;There&#8217;s no one working on a Gravatar app right now,&#8221; Mullenweg said, confirming that the idea was considered and then scrapped. What they learned in the process was more valuable than delivering on the original idea.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Usage is oxygen for ideas, right? The things that we know and learn by releasing stuff, we never could have learned otherwise, so look for more of that. That team has lots of things planned &#8211; their charter is specifically not to do things that integrate with WordPress. I&#8217;d love for it to be a much larger team, actually.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This spirit of experimentation is what sets Automattic apart from many other companies that simply focus on their successful products. Perhaps it will someday translate into technology that can work alongside WordPress, especially when the software adopts more modern APIs.</p>\n<h2>The Mission</h2>\n<p>In recent press, Automattic has received considerable attention due to the fact that the company doesn&#8217;t work from one centralized office. The idea is brand new to those who have only experienced more traditional workplaces. I asked Mullenweg what he believes is truly unique about his company. He cited a few things, such as the hiring process, the reliability of WordPress.com&#8217;s technical architecture, the dedication to experimentation. But in the end, for him, everything loops back around to the mission of democratizing publishing.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything that doesn&#8217;t exist in any other company. Obviously we&#8217;re really deeply involved with WordPress. So is 10up and many other WP consultancies. We do a ton of open source but so does Canonical, Acquia, Redhat, and everyone else. I think it&#8217;s just the combination of all of these things, the truly distributed nature, and the mission, which isn&#8217;t just about bottom lines. It has an altruistic aspect as well.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href="http://ma.tt/2014/09/five-for-the-future/" target="_blank">Five for the Future</a> post compelling open source companies to strive to contribute 5% back to the core software is a hotly debated topic in the WordPress ecosystem right now. Those who do not share the same practical convictions or altruistic ideals feel that the idea comes with an implication of people &#8220;working for free.&#8221; The folks at Automattic are hoping to lead the way in proving that commercial success can go hand-in-hand with an altruistic mission. For Mullenweg, it&#8217;s part of a larger vision and an unwavering commitment to ensure the future of WordPress for all.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 02 Oct 2014 18:31:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"Matt: Singapore Suites Class";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44174";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://ma.tt/2014/10/singapore-suites-class/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1153:"<p>Derek Low on What It&#8217;s like to Fly the $23,000 Singapore Airlines Suites Class [link removed, see end].

What a ride. <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-mrgreen" title=":mrgreen:">:mrgreen:</span></p>\n<p>There were two other times in Akismet history when we broke the daily record this many times in one month. In November 2011 we broke the daily record 8 times (!) and in December 2012, we broke it 6 times. Though, the numbers were much easier to beat then &#8211; 90 to 100 million daily spam comments in November 2011, and 177 to 196 million in December 2012.</p>\n<p>Here are the daily numbers for September, with the previous record marked for comparison:</p>\n<div id="attachment_1719" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/akismet-spam-and-ham-stats-sept-2014.png"><img class="wp-image-1719 size-large" src="http://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/akismet-spam-and-ham-stats-sept-2014.png?w=700&h=436" alt="We saw 7,955,568,000 spam comments go through this month, and 357,739,000 real comments." /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We saw 7,955,568,000 spam comments go through this month, and 357,739,000 real comments.</p></div>\n<p>You may have also seen a rise in your own spam comments this month.

A healthy mixture of veteran contributors were in attendance, as well as many folks who were brand new to contributing.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the day, contributors split off into smaller groups to focus on translations, core, documentation, theme review, support, GlotPress, and Rosetta. When Theme Review Team member Tammie Lister put out a call for theme reviewers, hands shot up all over the room. Automattic donates Lister&#8217;s time two or three days per week specifically for helping with WordPress.org theme review.</p>\n<p>After the event, she reported that 27 new people were added to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/" target="_blank">WordPress Theme Review Team</a>. They started by introducing themselves and discussing why one might want to get involved. Those who had some experience shared their individual processes. After this, they dove straight into reviewing and each person was given a theme.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The current idea is that during the month of October we will be focusing on how we do contribution days now, so we&#8217;re having experiments and thinking about ways to improve that,&#8221; Lister said. During the last <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2014/09/24/weekly-meeting-notes-2/" target="_blank">weekly meeting</a>, the Theme Review Team identified the pain points in adding reviewers and brainstormed ideas for onboarding new reviewers during contributor days. This includes the possibility of creating a doing_it_wrong() theme, as a project at WordCamp San Francisco, that can be used for education and testing. Lister said they will be playing with a few ideas at upcoming contribution days in San Francisco and Toronto.</p>\n<h3>A Room Full of Themers</h3>\n<p>The best part of getting a record number of new reviewers together was packing a room full of themers who were all buzzing about the craft of WordPress theming. &#8220;What was really exciting about today is that it wasn&#8217;t just developers,&#8221; Lister said. &#8220;We had some people who didn&#8217;t know much HTML, some who were newer to theming, and some who were doing it the right way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The key thing for new reviewers is to take your time, Lister said. &#8220;I think the thing is that you just have to take it slowly when you start theme reviewing. You go through the process and you get faster.&#8221;</p>\n<p>New reviewer <a href="https://twitter.com/andrew_liyanage" target="_blank">Andrew Liyanage</a> decided to jump in and join the Theme Review Team in order to sharpen his professional skills. &#8220;I wanted to get into theme design. I thought before designing a theme, I could get into review in order to get to know what the do&#8217;s and the don&#8217;ts are,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m already reviewing a theme right now, and it&#8217;s going better than I thought it would.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lister plans to match each new reviewer with someone from the new <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-to-launch-mentoring-program" target="_blank">mentoring program</a>, established last month. Although most of the communication happens on trac, there are more people than ever to help out with the process.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of it is trac focused, because it has to be, but we now have mentors, more admins, and trusted reviewers. So there&#8217;s a lot more people but there&#8217;s a lot more people looking after those people,&#8221; Lister said.</p>\n<p>With a record number of new theme reviewers added in one day, the team now has 27 more people who are familiar with the guidelines. This is bound to make a significant dent in the queue and lighten the load for the rest of the team.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 01 Oct 2014 09:52:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"Post Status: Contribution as culture";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"http://www.poststat.us/?p=7153";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://www.poststat.us/contribution-culture/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12488:"<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7157" src="http://www.poststat.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/five-percent-752x250.gif" alt="five-percent" width="627" height="208" /></p>\n<p><em>This post spends a lot of time analyzing and referencing two other blog posts. Excuse me for that, but also be sure to read both, as they are relevant for this post and also interesting in their own right.</em></p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg wrote a blog post called <a href="http://ma.tt/2014/09/five-for-the-future/">Five for the Future</a> yesterday that advocates his belief that WordPress-centric companies should aim to utilize 5% of their company resources toward contributing back to the project.</p>\n<p>He noted in the post that <a href="http://automattic.com">Automattic</a> isn&#8217;t quite to this point, but that they are working on it, and describes why he believes it&#8217;s important. He closes with this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s a big commitment, but I can’t think of a better long-term investment in the health of WordPress overall. <strong>I think it will look incredibly modest in hindsight.</strong> This ratio is probably the bare minimum for a sustainable ecosystem, avoiding the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of the commons</a>. I think the 5% rule is one that all open source projects and companies should follow, at least if they want to be vibrant a decade from now.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This was followed up by one of the co-founders of one of the very hosting companies Matt partially referenced in his post &#8212; WP Engine&#8217;s Ben Metcalfe &#8212; who responded with a blog post of his own: <a href="http://benmetcalfe.com/blog/2014/09/wordpress-what-exactly-do-they-get-for-their-5/">WordPress: What exactly do they get for their 5%?</a></p>\n<p>I think I was immediately thrown off by Ben&#8217;s post title, but so many times throughout reading it I was shocked at how he made assumptions of Matt&#8217;s intentions or missed what I would call &#8220;the point&#8221;.</p>\n<h3>5% is not a decree</h3>\n<p>Obviously, Matt is not speaking from the mountaintop with a proclamation of law. This is his recommendation &#8212; one that he believes will reward the firms that strive for it.</p>\n<p>I believe that the community has already shown us that those that invest into WordPress are rewarded from it. We improve our understanding of a foundational software of our careers, improve our skills, are more marketable, more attractive to employers, and create natural opportunities for developing industry relationships.</p>\n<p>How should 5% of &#8220;people&#8221; be defined? I&#8217;m pretty sure Matt would agree that 5% of people or 5% of revenue toward people doesn&#8217;t really matter to him; yet Ben makes a continuous sticking point about the cost of &#8212; and need for &#8212; engineers.</p>\n<p>Additionally, while Matt utilizes full-time employees, the same (or better) effect could be had with shared time from more employees.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not big into absolutes, so it&#8217;s important to remember that while I&#8217;m advocating that Matt&#8217;s recommendation of 5% time, I think it&#8217;s simply a good recommendation. This is a free economy and companies can do what they want. But I think in the current and long term, contribution will be key to greater corporate success for those that choose to do so.</p>\n<h3>What does 5% cost, and who does it require?</h3>\n<p><span id="more-7153"></span></p>\n<blockquote><p>While Matt was careful to include numerous non-engineering roles companies could help with, ultimately what drives the open source project is source code contribution by software engineers. &#8230;</p>\n<p>A reasonable engineer in the US costs $100k/y, and if you factor in benefits <em>(tax funded health-care, anyone?)</em> and overheads you could easily be looking at $130k or more per person, per year. &#8230;</p>\n<p>A 200+ person web hosting company would need to hire 10 engineers to meet a 5% goal, requiring a budget of anything between $1MM-1.3MM+ per year. Those engineers probably need a manager – to mentor them, provide career development etc. Those 11 people also put pressure on human resources, finance, legal, facilities etc – probably equating to another person again. Now we’re talking probably more like $1.25-$1.5m annually.</p></blockquote>\n<p>First, I believe Ben has spent too much time in the world&#8217;s largest cities if he believes engineers cost $100,000 per year on average. In my experience (yes, I interview people myself), that&#8217;s not the case, and based on my decent view of the ecosystem it&#8217;s not an appropriate going rate &#8212; especially if the offer on the table is a particularly desirable position.</p>\n<p>More importantly, <strong>the project needs far more non-technical contributors</strong>. Ben&#8217;s assertion that &#8220;ultimately&#8221; software engineers drive the project is not true. Users drive the project. A technically savvy user-minded contributor can be a beacon of light to a group of software developers. And given the user-facing nature of WordPress itself, non-engineer contributors could drastically improve the less code-sexy parts of the WordPress ecosystem: project management, docs, training, testing, support, translation, etc.</p>\n<p>Additional to &#8220;core&#8221; contributions, WordCamps, plugins, themes, communities, and many other venues are outstanding places where contributors &#8212; yes, they&#8217;re still contributors! &#8212; can impact the overall project.</p>\n<p>Finally, as I noted above, I think companies could quite effectively contribute parts of employees&#8217; time versus dedicated 100% time, which would also prevent the need to have dedicated managers for open source contributors.</p>\n<h3>Foundational software to your business</h3>\n<p>Ben spends a chunk of time saying that big companies like GoDaddy get a &#8220;get out of jail free card&#8221; and that obviously Matt wouldn&#8217;t expect they dedicate 5% of their thousands of employees.</p>\n<p>GoDaddy definitely benefits from WordPress and they also contribute to it; and no, they don&#8217;t contribute 5% I&#8217;m sure. But WordPress is not foundational to GoDaddy&#8217;s business. They have a dedicated sub-product for it, and they also have many contributors to it.</p>\n<p>WP Engine, and many others (including mine), are almost completely or completely reliant on WordPress as a platform. WordPress and its underlying technologies are foundational to our careers and businesses.</p>\n<p>It is simply a different story to compare a company that would continue on pretty much fine without WordPress and one that would have to seriously reconsider their entire business model.</p>\n<p>For example, let&#8217;s compare the scenario to a publisher. <a href="http://recode.net">Re/code</a> is built on WordPress. They have a staff of 20+. Do they <em>completely rely</em> on WordPress for their website? Yes. For their business model? No. In their scenario, it makes sense for them &#8212; and could benefit them pretty directly &#8212; to allocate some time of some employees to WordPress, but if WordPress disappears they can and will migrate to a different platform.</p>\n<h3>Contributing to the full stack</h3>\n<p>It was questioned to me on Twitter, after my initial reaction to Ben&#8217;s post, whether I contribute 5% of my time to open source projects like PHP, MySQL, and other tools that WordPress relies on.</p>\n<p>This is a good question and point, but it does not cause me to stumble in my opinions. I believe open source contributions in general benefit the entire software stack.</p>\n<p>In my scenario, I can be more impactful on the WordPress project than others. But I believe contributions can take many shapes, in both directions.</p>\n<p>Some folks, like Daniel Bachhuber, greatly contribute to the project as a whole by supporting upstream projects like <a href="http://wp-cli.org">WP CLI.</a></p>\n<p>Automattic is a fantastic example of a company that has both upstream and downstream contributions. They are active contributors to, employers of contributors or founders, or monetary sponsors to a huge number of downstream projects: WordPress, PHP, Nginx, jQuery, Elastic Search, Node, Socket.io, and probably a bunch I can&#8217;t think of or don&#8217;t know about. Additionally, they are a driving force behind dozens of upstream, open source themes and plugins.</p>\n<p><em>Edit: Matt <a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/517270097355091968">says in a Tweet</a> where Andrey Savchenko asked for clarification about PHP contributions that Automattic doesn&#8217;t actively contribute to PHP. Though I think I define contribution a bit more loosely than Matt does.</em></p>\n<p>Whether a company is contributing to their foundational piece of software, a downstream or upstream application, or on an adjacent aspect that leads to the betterment of the platform that is foundational to their business objectives, then I believe it will in turn be beneficial to their bottom line.</p>\n<h3>Contribution as culture</h3>\n<p>Contribution should not be considered an isolated cost, but an enabling investment.</p>\n<p>If I run a business that relies on a foundational piece of software like WordPress, then it benefits me greatly for my employees &#8212; no matter what role they play within the company &#8212; to be intimately familiar with that software.</p>\n<p>In my last job, I was tasked with guiding a transition of my company from developing mostly on a proprietary CMS to WordPress. I consistently preached the importance for everyone in the company to understand some fundamentals of WordPress itself. During my time there and since I&#8217;ve moved on, I&#8217;ve seen other members of that company learn the software, get involved in our local community, and even contribute back to WordPress itself; and both they and the company are better off for it.</p>\n<p>Whether an employee is in sales, customer service, design, development, management, or wherever else &#8212; every employee knowing your product is important. I firmly believe this. I would want anyone in an organization I&#8217;m part of to be able to discuss our product in detail and with confidence to anyone.</p>\n<p>When your company relies on a foundational piece of software &#8212; such as those we&#8217;re discussing in this post &#8212; that&#8217;s in effect part of your product. We are building products and services around and for WordPress. How important should it be that our company&#8217;s employees understand it?</p>\n<p>And how can they understand it better? By contributing of course!</p>\n<p>Have a new support rep? Show them the WordPress.org forums to get their feet wet. New designer or front-end developer? Have them sit in on default theme conversations or read through the Make UI blog. New sales person? Get them involved at your local meetup and WordCamp. This list can go on.</p>\n<p>Avenues for contribution are an incredible gateway for learning WordPress. Blogging about WordPress (another avenue of contribution) has greatly enabled me to be better at my job, and therefore made me significantly more valuable to the companies I&#8217;ve worked with.</p>\n<h3>Five for now</h3>\n<p>Matt called his post Five for the Future, and talked specifically about how a 5% investment by a company will ensure a greater future for WordPress and therefore said company. I disagree.</p>\n<p>Contributing now will benefit the company and its employees <em>right now</em>. And while both Matt and Ben focused on individuals within the company being targeted contributors, I think it&#8217;s much more beneficial to have a much larger percentage of a company contributing a portion of their time (even if small). I&#8217;d rather see 2 of 200 employees be full time contributors and then have 80 10% contributors than have 10 full time contributors.</p>\n<p>I think we&#8217;ve seen many, many examples of contributors (people and companies) reaping tangible and intangible benefits from when they contribute &#8212; whether that contribution is to the codebase or the community. Contributors in this ecosystem come out on top.</p>\n<p>Contributions are not an isolated cost or burden. Nor should their effects be limited to good faith investments to the sustainability of the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Contributions benefit the bottom line, and they benefit the bottom line right now.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 01 Oct 2014 06:17:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"WPTavern: Interview With Stream Project Lead, Frankie Jarrett";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=31664";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"http://wptavern.com/interview-with-stream-project-lead-frankie-jarrett";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9745:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/FrankieJarretFeaturedImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[31664]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31673" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/FrankieJarretFeaturedImage.png?resize=651%2C246" alt="Frankie Jarrett Featured Image" /></a></p>\n<p>Stream 2.0 is a <a title="http://wptavern.com/stream-morphs-from-a-plugin-into-a-service" href="http://wptavern.com/stream-morphs-from-a-plugin-into-a-service">significant update</a> that changes the stand alone plugin into a service. But not everyone is happy with the change. Those who use Stream in enterprise environments have voiced disappointment regarding the latest update. The following is feedback from a user on the <a title="https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/?fref=nf" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/?fref=nf">Advanced WordPress Facebook group</a>. &#8220;Heads up if you use Stream.

Evans</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p><strong>Jeff &#8211; Why the decision to use an external service by default to offload Stream activity data?</strong></p>\n<p>Over the past 10 months we’ve learned a lot about logging events, specifically logging actions taken inside the WordPress Admin. As time went on, some of the biggest concerns we had revolved around the topics of performance and security. It became clear to us that Stream needed to be more than just a plugin to advance into a solid solution, it needed to be a service that was self-contained and lived alongside WordPress instead of trying to force it to work inside the WordPress architecture and never truly being scalable or secure.</p>\n<p>MySQL is nice solution for storing content with simple querying, this is how WordPress uses it, but MySQL is actually bad for storing logs, especially if you want to retain them for a long time and/or run complex queries on them while also expecting those queries to be fast. Not to mention, you don’t want the performance of your website’s content to be affected at all. Since the primary purpose of the MySQL database is to store and serve up content to your website visitors, it was our view that should never be hindered by event logging.</p>\n<p>Now that Stream is a service, we can use brand new technologies like <a title="http://www.elasticsearch.org/" href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elasticsearch</a>, that are better suited for (and even designed for) querying huge numbers of logs. The result is a more powerful querying performance, the possibility for users to do even more complex queries in the future (for their Reports), and have no worries about keeping logs for a very, very long time. The things we are now doing in Stream 2.0, and plan to do in the future, require the power of Elasticsearch and don’t translate into MySQL storage solutions.</p>\n<p>In regards to security, websites and databases get hacked all the time. Unfortunately that’s just the way it is. Since all of Stream’s records had previously lived inside the website, it too was as vulnerable as the website itself. This means that any hacker that gained access could mess up a site and then cover up their tracks by simply deleting the Stream log data. This was a bad thing and meant those logs weren’t really a true security audit trail at all. Now that Stream is a service, those logs are untouchable by an intruder. Once an action is performed, it’s forever in the event history, so the site owner knows without a doubt what things have happened on their site and can go through an undo the damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff &#8211; Why the connection between Stream and WordPress.com ID logins?</strong></p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/WordPressStreamConnection.png" rel="prettyphoto[31664]"><img class="size-full wp-image-31671" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/WordPressStreamConnection.png?resize=639%2C200" alt="WordPress Stream Connection" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/manchester-monkey/5432450932/">Manchester-Monkey</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>This was an easy decision for us, actually. Over the past few years there have been several WordPress companies that have had their sites hacked and user passwords have been compromised as a result. It’s a sad and unfortunate thing that can be avoided by simply not storing them. Our solution for this was to use SSO (Single sign on) powered by <a title="https://wordpress.com/" href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>.</p>\n<p>This means Stream doesn’t have to store any login details for any customer and customers don’t have to sign up for yet another account somewhere. Furthermore, <a title="http://en.support.wordpress.com/security/two-step-authentication/" href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/security/two-step-authentication/">WP.com SSO supports two-factor authentication</a>. This is a huge win for folks who are really concerned about the security of their logins, and we wanted Stream to have this capability.</p>\n<p>The reason why we chose WP.com SSO was because of its status and reach in the WordPress community. Stream is a WordPress product and service, so it only makes sense to reach as many WordPress users as possible. When you think about all the people who use Jetpack, Gravatar, Akismet, VaultPress and Polldaddy &#8211; that’s a lot of people. Maybe not everyone, but again, we wanted to make a decisive decision not to store user login credentials at all, and that could mean some people might not be able to use it, but it’s for the good of all our users. WordPress.com SSO was also very easy to implement on our WordPress-powered site compared with the Facebook, Twitter or Google SSO alternatives.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff &#8211; Is the connection between Stream and WordPress.com similar to Jetpack in that some things won’t work without the connection?</strong></p>\n<p>The only time Stream needs to talk to WordPress.com is during sign up, for login credentials. Stream doesn’t <em>ping</em> back to your website like Jetpack does. This means your site doesn’t have to be publicly accessible for Stream to work and can be run on a local/development environment without any problems or extra steps needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff &#8211; Overall, what are the future plans for Stream now that it’s morphed into a service?</strong></p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/FutureOfStream.png" rel="prettyphoto[31664]"><img class="size-full wp-image-31672" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/FutureOfStream.png?resize=639%2C200" alt="Future of Stream" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/wwarby/9641216546/">wwarby</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>Now that we have some scalability, performance and security milestones behind us, we are very much looking forward to making Stream even better in the coming months and years. You might have already noticed, but Stream 2.0 featured built-in integration with eight popular WordPress plugins. We intend to continue making Stream compatible out-of-the-box with tracking things that many other popular plugins do.</p>\n<p>Another thing we plan to do is open up a <strong>REST API</strong> for people to be able to access their data and do anything they want with it. This is a very exciting prospect. Finally, we are working on ways to have a complete “mash-up” of all of your Stream data in one place. This is based on a lot of feedback we’ve been getting from folks who run not just multi-site, but multiple single-site installs for their clients and want to see everything that’s happening in one place.

This version features a rewrite from the ground up with a focus on <em>scalability, security</em>, and <em>activity</em>. As part of the rewrite, Stream activity data is stored in the cloud using <a title="http://aws.amazon.com/" href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> with <a title="http://www.elasticsearch.org/" href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elasticsearch</a>. This is the same type of setup Jetpack uses to power its <a title="http://jetpack.me/support/related-posts/" href="http://jetpack.me/support/related-posts/">Related Posts</a> module.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ConnectToStream.png" rel="prettyphoto[31615]"><img class="size-full wp-image-31654" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ConnectToStream.png?resize=989%2C120" alt="Connect To Stream Service" /></a>Request For a WordPress.com ID\n<p>The data is stored over an SSL connection making it hard to tap into your activity stream. The Stream team explains the plugin as being the <em>black box</em> of a WordPress site that even the NSA can&#8217;t penetrate. As part of the security enhancements, <span class="wp-stream-tooltip">Stream uses your WordPress.com ID to authorize your account. </span></p>\n<p><span class="wp-stream-tooltip">After connecting my WordPress.com ID to Stream, it loaded a <a title="https://wp-stream.com/pricing/" href="https://wp-stream.com/pricing/">Plans and Pricing page</a> in place of the backend instead of just connecting my account. This is unexpected behavior and a disappointing user experience. I ended up having to load the WordPress backend in a new browser tab. </span></p>\n<p>I ran into a loop where each time I logged into the backend of WordPress, I&#8217;d see the <strong>Connect to Stream</strong> notification. Each time I clicked the button, it would load the Plans and Pricing page. As it turns out, the reason for the endless loop is because I didn&#8217;t have a subscription registered with the Stream website. Once I completed the process of registering for a free account, the WordPress backend loaded the Stream records screen.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SuccessfulConnectionToStream.png" rel="prettyphoto[31615]"><img class="size-full wp-image-31655" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SuccessfulConnectionToStream.png?resize=765%2C336" alt="Successful Connection To Stream" /></a>Successful Connection To Stream\n<p>I recommend text be added to the top of the Plans and Pricing page. The text should explain that in order to complete the connection to Stream, a subscription plan needs to be selected. It&#8217;s not obvious and gave me the impression the plugin is broken.</p>\n<h2>Support For SMS Notifications Thanks to an Outside Source</h2>\n<p>One of the neat features in 2.0 is the ability to set up SMS notifications. For instance, every time a theme, plugin, or WordPress is updated, you can configure Stream to send you a text message.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ConfiguringSMSNotifcations.png" rel="prettyphoto[31615]"><img class="size-full wp-image-31656" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ConfiguringSMSNotifcations.png?resize=1025%2C552" alt="Configuring SMS Notifications In Stream" /></a>Configuring SMS Notifications In Stream\n<p>SMS notifications ended up in 2.0 thanks to the contributing efforts of <a title="https://jeffmatson.net/" href="https://jeffmatson.net/">Jeff Matson</a>. Matson is the author of the <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-sms-notifications/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-sms-notifications/">WP SMS Notifications</a> plugin <a title="http://wptavern.com/keep-track-of-changes-to-your-wordpress-site-with-the-wp-sms-notifications-plugin" href="http://wptavern.com/keep-track-of-changes-to-your-wordpress-site-with-the-wp-sms-notifications-plugin">we highlighted on the Tavern</a> back in July. Matson explains why he decided to contribute to the Stream project, &#8220;When I created WP SMS Notifications, the biggest comment I received was that I should work with Stream to add my functionality to their plugin. The team behind Stream agreed and I was given access to their Github account. Now, I can proudly say that my code is behind one of the greatest activity tracking plugins out there.&#8221; However, the only way to take advantage of SMS notifications is to use the Pro account which is available for <strong>$2 per month</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Older Version of Stream Will Remain Available For Download</h2>\n<p>Stream has undergone major changes and is now a service versus a stand alone plugin. For those who don&#8217;t want to update to the new version, the Stream Team is leaving the <a title="https://github.com/wp-stream/stream/releases/tag/1.4.9" href="https://github.com/wp-stream/stream/releases/tag/1.4.9">previous version online</a> via Github. Versions 1.4.9 and below won&#8217;t receive any more updates outside of patching major bugs or security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h2>Overall, a Solid Update</h2>\n<p>Stream 2.0 is a solid update. The latest edition supports activity tracking for eight of the most popular WordPress plugins out-of-the box including: Advanced Custom Fields, bbPress, BuddyPress, Easy Digital Downloads, Gravity Forms, Jetpack, WooCommerce and WordPress SEO by Yoast. SMS notification is a great enhancement and I think it&#8217;s respectable of the team to keep 1.4.9 available for those that don&#8217;t like the new direction Stream is heading in.</p>\n<p>Are you satisfied with the latest update to Stream?

After browsing the WordPress plugin directory and coming up empty, Haskins is developing his own solution in the form of a plugin.</p>\n<p>He describes the plugin will have a similar setup to <a title="https://www.statuspage.io/" href="https://www.statuspage.io/">StatusPage.io</a>. &#8220;It would definitely have a mechanism to determine if a supplied URL and/or database is down or not. But the page would be more &#8220;alive&#8221; then a static <strong>coming soon page</strong> with the ability to send notifications (email/SMS) to users in addition to showing real-time status updates with a history of events,&#8221; Haskins told the Tavern.</p>\n<div>Haskins explains how the plugin would work. &#8220;You&#8217;d provide a subset of items like maybe a URL, database , API endpoint, and we&#8217;d ping that and return the status in a pretty way. I think the key making this really work would be to provide some level of automation as in, a developer could push a commit to Github or Bitbucket with a specific tag that would then automatically update a message status on the status page.</div>\n<div></div>\n<p>An example of a status page is the Amazon Web Services health dashboard.

It doesn&#8217;t make sense to host a status page on the same server as the project. Instead of forcing users to sign up for a cheap hosting account, Haskins may turn it into a hosted service. One option to consider is using <a title="https://www.openshift.com/" href="https://www.openshift.com/">OpenShift Online</a>.

In our ecosystem web hosts definitely make the most revenue and profits, and it&#8217;s been great to see them stepping up their game, but also the consultancies and agencies around WordPress have been pretty amazing about their people contributions, as demonstrated most recently by the fact the 4.0 and 4.1 release leads both hail from WP agencies (<a href="http://10up.com/">10up</a> and <a href="http://codeforthepeople.com/">Code for the People</a>, respectively).</p>\n<p>I think a good rule of thumb that will scale with the community as it continues to grow is that organizations that want to grow the <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> pie (and not just their piece of it) should <strong>dedicate 5% of their people to working on something to do with core</strong> &#8212; be it development, documentation, security, support forums, theme reviews, training, testing, translation or whatever it might be that helps move WordPress mission forward.</p>\n<p>Five percent doesn&#8217;t sound like much, but it adds up quickly. As of today <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> is 277 people, which means we should have about 14 people contributing full-time. That&#8217;s a lot of people to not have on things that are more direct or obvious drivers of the business, and we&#8217;re not quite there today, but I&#8217;m working on it and hope Automattic can set a good example for this in the community. I think it&#8217;s just as hard for a 20-person organization to peel 1 person off.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a big commitment, but I can&#8217;t think of a better long-term investment in the health of WordPress overall. <strong>I think it will look incredibly modest in hindsight.</strong> This ratio is probably the bare minimum for a sustainable ecosystem, avoiding the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of the commons</a>. I think the 5% rule is one that all open source projects and companies should follow, at least if they want to be vibrant a decade from now.</p>\n<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> There&#8217;s been a number of nice blog follow-ups.

WordCampers arrived excited to soak up new information and connect with others in the European community.</p>\n<p>Sofia&#8217;s graffiti-lined streets are peppered with leftovers of communist architecture, contrasting the Neo-Bohemian culture that energizes the city. The event was held in the National Palace of Culture, a magnificent venue situated in the center of Bulgaria&#8217;s capital, designed nearly a decade before the fall of the Iron Curtain. Its halls are lined with murals and dark colors, which created an interesting backdrop for a conference devoted to a bright and growing free software community.</p>\n<p>The warm hospitality of the organizers of WordCamp Europe lent an intimate atmosphere to what otherwise might have seemed like an impersonally large event. Attendees enjoyed a world class lineup of WordPress speakers and had the opportunity to try delicious local specialties during breaks and lunch.</p>\n<h3>Organizing WordCamp Europe 2014</h3>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wceu-volunteers.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[31620]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wceu-volunteers.jpg?resize=1025%2C485" alt="wceu-volunteers" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31631" /></a></p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe is an event that requires many months of planning and an army of volunteers to make it happen. Local organizer <a href="https://twitter.com/petyeah" target="_blank">Petya Raykovska</a> helped to organize WordCamp Sofia&#8217;s 300 attendees last year, in addition to being part of the WCEU organizing team. She commented on how welcoming and helpful the Bulgarian community has been in hosting the event. &#8220;We have a bunch of local volunteers who have been amazing. Everybody wants to help,&#8221; she said. <strong>&#8220;But that is WordPress everywhere, not just in Bulgaria. People in WordPress share these same values in common.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>Out of the event&#8217;s 950 attendees, 240 were Bulgarian, with the vast majority of others from outside the country. WordCamp Europe is made up of an international team of organizers, strategically chosen to unite the different areas of the Europe. The location of the event changes every year and potential host cities have the opportunity to compete for the spot by submitting a proposal and demonstrating support from the local community, much like the Olympics. This year it was a close competition between Lisbon and Sofia.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Any local community that has had a WordCamp before has the opportunity to bid,&#8221; explained <a href="https://twitter.com/DeFries" target="_blank">Remkus de Vries</a>, a leader in the Dutch WordPress community and one of the original organizers of WCEU. &#8220;They have to have experience and know how to manage everything.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In its first year, WordCamp Europe was held in Leiden, located in Western Europe. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just who has the best story,&#8221; De Vries commented on the selection process. <strong>&#8220;We have an agenda, and the agenda is to unite Europe as best as we can and to have open source be the vehicle.</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;We picked Sofia because we thought it would be good to have Eastern Europe be a part of it. We have a large WordPress community in Romania, Bulgaria, and a few neighboring countries like Serbia and Croatia,&#8221; he said. For them it&#8217;s relatively easy to come here and we wanted to have them here.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>No Boundaries: Uniting People Across Borders with WordPress</h3>\n<p>The European WordPress community has a checkered history of division. De Vries and fellow organizers founded the event in 2013, with the hopes of uniting different languages, nationalities, and cultures in a way that only WordPress can.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Diversity,&#8221; is the one word answer De Vries gave when asked about the distinguishing characteristics of the community. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had a lot of issues with countries not liking each other in the last seven years, and that, in some regard, is somewhat always there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/zedejose" target="_blank">Zé</a> and I had the idea in 2009/2010 that we should have a European WordCamp, for the simple reason that when we went to the other EU WordCamps, we saw that there was the beginning of people looking outside their borders when it came to the WordPress community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>De Vries highlighted a few of the differences that the EU community has to overcome. &#8220;If you just look at the way we write, from the Cyrillic alphabet to the Greek to the Latin ones, that&#8217;s a big difference,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Additionally, there are cultural differences between Eastern, Western, Northern and Southern Europe. Obviously you have stuff like that in America as well but this is truly different in a lot of senses. One of our goals was that the local communities would start looking outside of themselves. That&#8217;s exactly what happened.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Prior to the first WordCamp Europe, many across the continent kept to their own small communities and didn&#8217;t often travel to connect with each other. De Vries shared an example of how things have changed:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I would say Germany is a beautiful example. Germany is a very close knit community, one of the strongest running and one of the oldest, other than the US. Earlier this year WordCamp Hamburg had many foreigners in attendance. That didn&#8217;t happen in Germany in the past. That&#8217;s the big difference. Now they&#8217;re looking outside.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Once everyone comes together around WordPress, differences disappear. &#8220;There&#8217;s a funny thing about the people who enjoy WordPress, in the raw sense of the word, is that they tend to be people who like each other in real life,&#8221; De Vries said. &#8220;Which is why I think WordCamps are such a huge success. I can&#8217;t speak that much for other open source communities but I do have a feeling that that&#8217;s something special about the WordPress community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe is so well-supported that within two or three days, every single sponsor package was sold out, despite the fact that they weren&#8217;t featured very well in the previous year. Companies are still lining up to offer support, because they recognize the value of a unifying event like this in Europe.</p>\n<h3>Looking to the Future of WordCamp Europe</h3>\n<p>De Vries and many of the core organizing team are in it for the foreseeable future. He&#8217;s addicted to the high of connecting people who might not otherwise have the opportunity to connect with their peers. &#8220;Yes, it costs a lot of time. I have a busy company as well, but I just think it&#8217;s worth it,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Why does he continue to put so much time into WordPress? De Vries put it simply. &#8220;WordPress saved my life. It allowed me to come out of a very dark place to make money to provide for my family at a time when I was experiencing something very rough,&#8221; he said. He wouldn&#8217;t have been able to get there without the community surrounding the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is the way the software is structured and the way the community is structured around that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It makes it very easy to jump in anytime. If you put in the hours and you want to learn and understand what it&#8217;s about and translate that into your work, I would say that WordPress is as good as a community can get. So for me, giving back is also part of that. &#8221;</p>\n<p>The first year WordCamp Europe sold 750 tickets. This year it reached 950, despite the fact that travel to Bulgaria is more difficult for some. With the exception of a few direct flights, most everyone else has two or three connecting flights to make it to Sofia. &#8220;To see that the attendance has actually risen, I think is a testament to what we&#8217;re doing here,&#8221; De Vries remarked.</p>\n<p>When asked if they will expand the event&#8217;s attendance next year, he replied, &#8220;Maybe 1200 would be nice. I think if we pick a location that&#8217;s even more of a direct flight, attendance could go in that direction.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But for De Vries, attendance is of less importance than the unifying power of the WordCamp. <strong>&#8220;Attendance is not the end goal. The goal is people of different countries and backgrounds realizing that, in this community, there are no boundaries.&#8221;</strong></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 14:48:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"Matt: No Longer Use TimThumb";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44172";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://ma.tt/2014/09/no-longer-use-timthumb/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:195:"<p>Ben Gillbanks, the co-author of TimThumb, says <a href="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2014/07/dont-use-timthumb-instead/">I No Longer Use TimThumb &#8212; Here&#8217;s What I do Instead</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 06:24:05 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Matt Mullenweg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"WPTavern: GoDaddy and Media Temple Engage in Strategic Partnership With WP101";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=31536";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"http://wptavern.com/godaddy-and-media-temple-engage-in-strategic-partnership-with-wp101";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13362:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/WP101Logo.png" rel="prettyphoto[31536]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-31599" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/WP101Logo.png?resize=186%2C96" alt="WP101 Logo" /></a>Customers who host sites with <a title="https://www.godaddy.com/" href="https://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a> or <a title="http://mediatemple.net/" href="http://mediatemple.net/">Media Temple</a> will see a new WordPress resource in their control panel.

He also shares the valuable lessons he learned during the process. Near the end of the interview, he provides a list of resources for those interested in learning WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Interview With WP101 Founder, Shawn Hesketh</h2>\n<p><strong>Jeff &#8211; How difficult has been for you to keep up with WordPress development through your training videos?</strong></p>\n<p>To be perfectly honest with you, I was a bit nervous when I first heard Matt Mullenweg <a title="http://wordpress.tv/2013/07/29/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2013/" href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/07/29/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2013/">outline a strategy</a> for increasingly rapid releases, eventually leading to constant background updates to WordPress at some point in the near future. But so far, it&#8217;s been fairly manageable, as we&#8217;ve only seen an additional one or two revision cycles in a given year.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve given a great deal of thought to how we might continue to keep the <a title="https://www.wp101.com/courses/wordpress101/" href="https://www.wp101.com/courses/wordpress101/">WordPress 101 tutorial series</a> up-to-date should WordPress move to more transparent and automatic updates. But for the time being, we should be able to continue updating and re-recording our videos with each major release.</p>\n<p>I continually monitor the WordPress development blog, Trac, and the IRC channel, which helps me stay abreast of coming changes and prepare ahead of time as much as possible. Without access to those invaluable resources, it would be quite a challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff &#8211; As WordPress continues to grow, WordPress Training continues to be a business in high demand. How have you differentiated yourself from the other trainers/coaches out there?</strong></p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CMSMarketShareWordPress.png" rel="prettyphoto[31536]"><img class="size-full wp-image-31603" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CMSMarketShareWordPress.png?resize=698%2C291" alt="CMS MarketShare report" /></a>Marketshare via OpensourceCMS.com 9/29/2014\n<p>It certainly helps that WP101 was one of the first WordPress video tutorial series to be launched, way back in 2008, at a time when almost no one was providing high-quality WordPress tutorial videos. Since then, we&#8217;ve certainly seen a number of other sites emerge to address the growing need for WordPress education, not only for beginners, but also intermediate and advanced users.</p>\n<p>Still, the feedback I receive almost daily is that the WP101 videos are some of the best-produced, easy-to-follow video tutorials for beginners. I&#8217;ve spoken about this in the past, but I maintain that fanatical attention to detail and careful craftsmanship can still help differentiate you from competitors, no matter what product or service you provide.</p>\n<p>Finally, I don&#8217;t create my tutorials in a vacuum. Rather than simply producing what <strong>I</strong> think will work best, I&#8217;m constantly listening to input and feedback from our audience, developers, and beginners alike revising the WP101 series, improving it with each release. I think it&#8217;s this commitment to building meaningful, long-term relationships and serving our audience that continues to set WP101 apart.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff &#8211; What challenges did you face in making this strategic partnership a reality?</strong></p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/WP101-GoDaddy-MediaTemple.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[31536]"><img class="size-full wp-image-31601" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/WP101-GoDaddy-MediaTemple.jpg?resize=900%2C500" alt="WP101 Partnership" /></a>Image Courtesy of WP101\n<p>The partnership with GoDaddy and Media Temple is a great example of the importance of long-term relationship building. We spent the first several weeks in conversations about the challenges they faced with regard to on-boarding new WordPress users. It was only after I had a clear understanding of their challenges that we began to explore the best way to put the WP101 videos to work for their customers.</p>\n<p>Although it may appear on the surface to be a relatively simple solution, it was actually the product of several months of hard work, both in terms of developing the custom software required and arriving at a pricing model that worked for both parties.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I didn’t expect the process to take several months to fully materialize, but this was never about a quick win. From the beginning, we were all working toward the best solution, not just for our two companies, but ultimately for their customers.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff &#8211; Did you learn any lessons that others can use when trying to partner with large, well-established brands and or companies?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Have patience</em>. Don&#8217;t underestimate the amount of time you (or your legal team) will spend carefully crafting an agreement that is truly a win/win.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s true that the best agreements are those in which <em>both</em> parties feel that they came out ahead. But as with anything of lasting value, it takes time. Time spent in conversations that results in a clear understanding of the desired outcome. Time spent carefully crafting a custom solution, rather than simply applying a quick fix. And throughout the entire process, keeping an eye firmly fixed on the end goal, which is ultimately to better serve the customer.</p>\n<p><em>Communicate clearly</em>. When there are large teams of people involved, it&#8217;s easy to get lines crossed. I’m a big fan of UIHD (<a title="http://unlessiheardifferently.com/" href="http://unlessiheardifferently.com/">Unless I Hear Differently</a>). It helps everyone involved stay crystal clear on roles and timeframes, who’s doing what, and when. It helps eliminate downtime due to unnecessary communication cycles. Keep emails simple, limited to just one question at a time, and close every communication with, &#8220;<em>Unless I hear differently…</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>Finally, don&#8217;t underestimate the importance of finding a great attorney, which also takes time. I&#8217;ve worked with general business attorneys in the past, but it&#8217;s another matter altogether to find an attorney who understands the intricacies of licensing intellectual property for online distribution. I went through several recommendations before finally finding a local attorney who had the understanding and expertise to craft the agreement we needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff &#8211; Last but not least, when you take a step back and look at the big picture, what do you see in terms of the WordPress training landscape?</strong></p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/LandscapeHorizon.png" rel="prettyphoto[31536]"><img class="size-full wp-image-31602" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/LandscapeHorizon.png?resize=638%2C280" alt="Landscape WordPress Training Horizon" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jixxer/8238528131/">Kristofer Williams</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>It&#8217;s an exciting time to be a WordPress educator. The increasing popularity of WordPress means there is also a growing demand for WordPress training. There have never been more educational resources available for nearly every level of expertise.</p>\n<p>From written tutorials and code snippets on individual blogs to personalized, one-on-one coaching, there is a wide variety of training available for just about every learning style. The WordPress community is filled with knowledgeable, friendly people who are willing to share their knowledge with others.</p>\n<p>But with so many resources out there, it can also be challenging, particularly for beginners, to separate the good from the bad. How do you know whether a tutorial is accurate, reliable, or up-to-date?</p>\n<p>With powerful tools like <a title="http://screenflow.en.softonic.com/mac" href="http://screenflow.en.softonic.com/mac">ScreenFlow</a> and <a title="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html" href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html">Camtasia</a>, it’s never been easier to create screencast tutorials. But it&#8217;s increasingly difficult to ensure they’re continually up to date with each new release of WordPress.</p>\n<p>In the six years since I launched WP101, I&#8217;ve updated and re-recorded my WordPress 101 series <strong>12 times</strong>. During that same period of time, I’ve seen several tutorial sites come and go. Their content becomes out-of-date after just one or two release cycles. As I mentioned earlier, it’s only going to become more challenging as WordPress continues to release updates more rapidly.</p>\n<p>So, it’s hard work, and quite tedious at times, but for those of us who truly enjoy the reward of teaching others how to use WordPress, it’s also a labor of love. But one of the things that excites me the most is the spirit of “co-opetition” that exists in the WordPress community.</p>\n<h3>Resources Hesketh Recommends for Learning WordPress</h3>\n<p>Some people learn best by reading. So I often recommend the excellent books by <a title="http://www.amazon.com/WordPress-Web-Developers-Introduction-Professionals/dp/1430258667" href="http://www.amazon.com/WordPress-Web-Developers-Introduction-Professionals/dp/1430258667">Stephanie Leary</a>, <a title="http://lisasabin-wilson.com/books/" href="http://lisasabin-wilson.com/books/">Lisa Sabin-Wilson</a>, or <a title="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-WordPress-Development-Brad-Williams/dp/111844227X" href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-WordPress-Development-Brad-Williams/dp/111844227X">Brad Williams and team</a>.</p>\n<p>Others learn best through one-on-one training, so I send them to <a href="http://bobwp.com">BobWP</a>.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s the ever-growing library of <a href="http://webdesign.com">web design webinars</a> by my friends at iThemes.</p>\n<p>I’m excited about the possibilities of <a href="http://www.sidekick.pro">SIDEKICK</a> for helping developers to create custom interactive walkthroughs.</p>\n<p>Nobody has a larger library of written tutorials than <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com">WPBeginner</a>.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are plugins like <a href="http://www.videousermanuals.com">Video User Manuals</a>, or our own <a href="http://wp101plugin.com">WP101 Plugin</a> that enable developers to provide WordPress tutorials directly in their clients&#8217; dashboard.</p>\n<p>To say nothing of learning sites like <a href="http://Lynda.com">Lynda.com</a> or <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>.</p>\n<p>With our new partnership with GoDaddy and Media Temple, we’re starting to provide valuable WordPress training right where customers need it most, in their own WordPress dashboard.</p>\n<p>Not a day goes by that I don’t recommend one or more of these excellent learning resources if I feel they might be the best fit for someone and many, if not all, of these folks do the same for WP101. This creates an environment in which everyone wins. Most importantly the individuals who just want to learn how to use WordPress to build a gorgeous blog or compelling business site.</p>\n<p>In a perfect world, WordPress would be so intuitive where no training or manual would be required. Until then, we’ll be there to help fill in the gaps, answer questions, and help folks learn how to use WordPress as quickly as possible.</p>\n<h2>A Win-Win Situation</h2>\n<p>As the WordPress training scene becomes increasingly crowded, it&#8217;s becoming more difficult to differentiate between all of the resources available. Partnering with a webhosting company is an excellent way for WordPress training materials to be seen by thousands of customers who might not otherwise be aware of their existence.</p>\n<p>The material also provides an opportunity to lessen the support burden. As customers learn the basics of WordPress, the support team can dedicate more resources towards difficult support queries.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a GoDaddy or Media Temple customer, let us know what you think of the videos in the comments.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 29 Sep 2014 21:31:54 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"WPTavern: Ben Gillbanks Announces The End of TimThumb";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=31588";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"http://wptavern.com/ben-gillbanks-announces-the-end-of-timthumb";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5202:"<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/TimThumbEndsFeaturedImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[31588]"><img class="size-full wp-image-31592" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/TimThumbEndsFeaturedImage.png?resize=637%2C289" alt="TimThumb Ends Development " /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/katy_bird/6661402027/">katybird</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>The once popular image resizing script known as TimThumb is <a title="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2014/09/timthumb-end-life/" href="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2014/09/timthumb-end-life/">no longer supported</a> according to co-creator, Ben Gillbanks. In 2011, <a title="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2011/08/timthumb-2/" href="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2011/08/timthumb-2/">TimThumb made headlines</a> when a major security vulnerability was discovered and used to hack into several websites.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The exploit that was found was a bug with the external image resize functionality and the fact it could be used to download and execute files. There was code in place that restricted the downloads to a whitelist of clean sites, but it wasn’t strict enough and so a hole was found that could inject php onto your server.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In 2009, <a title="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2009/07/a-brief-history-of-timthumb/" href="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2009/07/a-brief-history-of-timthumb/">Gillbanks estimated</a> that 95% of commercial WordPress themes supported TimThumb. Several major commercial theme companies such as WooThemes, <a title="http://www.woothemes.com/2011/08/timthumb-security-flaw-patch/" href="http://www.woothemes.com/2011/08/timthumb-security-flaw-patch/">used the script</a> in most of its products. This set the stage for thousands of sites to be affected by the vulnerability.</p>\n<p>The outcome of the event has weighed heavily on Gillbanks and is one of the primary reasons he&#8217;s giving up development.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In particular in 2010 there was <a href="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2011/08/timthumb-2/">a major security exploit</a> found and it hurt a lot of websites, my own included. There are still people who are suffering because of it. I’ve felt incredibly guilty about this for years now, and so my enthusiasm for TimThumb has dropped to nothing.</p>\n<p>Because of this lack of enthusiasm, and a fear of doing something else wrong, I have barely touched the code in years.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using TimThumb, Gillbanks <a title="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2014/07/dont-use-timthumb-instead/" href="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2014/07/dont-use-timthumb-instead/">recommends removing it</a> and using something else. An excellent alternative is the <a title="http://matthewruddy.github.io/Wordpress-Timthumb-alternative/" href="http://matthewruddy.github.io/Wordpress-Timthumb-alternative/">WordPress TimThumb Alternative</a> on Github. Created by Matthew Ruddy, the function uses WordPress&#8217; native resizing functions to mimic TimThumb resizing.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Notable Events</h2>\n<p>The following is a timeline of notable events surrounding TimThumb.

His journey with WordPress started much like many others, when his first patch was accepted seven years ago. This past weekend at WordCamp Europe, Blackbourn was named <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/09/27/john-blackbourn-is-leading-wordpress-4-1-and-announcing-new-committers/" target="_blank">WordPress 4.1 release lead</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure my first contribution was because I found a bug that annoyed me, so I thought I&#8217;ll patch that up and get it in there,&#8221; he said. Submitting bug reports led him to learn about Subversion, patching files, and the trac ticket manager. &#8220;That&#8217;s actually a great way for people to get into version control &#8211; when someone turns around and says &#8216;Write a patch for it,&#8217; and you have to go off and figure out how to do it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It started off as a hobby, Blackbourn said, &#8220;building my own websites and playing around a bit.&#8221; After awhile his freelance work started to take off. &#8220;Then I was lucky enough to be able to drop my hours down to part time while I ramped up my freelance work,&#8221; he said. A couple years later, he got a job at <a href="http://codeforthepeople.com/" target="_blank">Code For The People</a>, a WordPress development agency and WordPress.com VIP partner.</p>\n<p>Code for the People is made up of a flock of regular contributors to WordPress core, with founders who are passionately committed to giving back to open source software. When Blackbourn was put forward to lead the 4.1 release, his agency was behind him 110%.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had previously talked to Andrew Nacin about leading 3.9 and 4.0 and he&#8217;d already spoken to my bosses at Code For The People. They said, &#8216;Yeah go for it &#8211; we&#8217;ll give you time off work, adequate resources, and time to lead it.''&#8221;</p>\n<p>Simon Wheatley, one of the founders of CFTP, spoke at WordCamp Europe about running an open source business, during which his co-founder, Simon Dickson, <a href="https://twitter.com/simond/status/515834467781730304" target="_blank">commented</a> on donating Blackbourn&#8217;s time to core. <strong>&#8220;CFTP is a small team. Contributing John Blackbourn to WP Core won&#8217;t make our lives easy. But it&#8217;s important to us. We&#8217;ll find a way,&#8221;</strong> he said.</p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s on the horizon for WordPress 4.1?</h3>\n<p>This will be the first time that Blackbourn has led a release, although he has been a core committer for both 3.9 and 4.0. WordPress 4.1 will be a short release cycle, with less than three months, due around December 12th. He shared a few ideas with us about where he thinks 4.1 will be heading.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re going to try to reign in expectations for the release so we&#8217;re going to get a few nice things to do with session management and password security, etc. If we keep the potential features reigned in a bit, then hopefully we won&#8217;t be needing to take weeks off work. I expect to be doing a couple days a week that I would normally be working.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Blackbourn hopes to further extend the improvements to sessions that were made in the previous release. &#8220;The new thing in WP 4.0 is the sessions &#8211; when you log in, you actually get assigned a session now, so you can forcibly log one of your sessions out,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;So if I&#8217;m logged in on my laptop and my phone I can kick myself out of one or the other.&#8221; This now exists in WordPress on an API level and Blackbourn is hopeful that 4.1 will add a UI for it.</p>\n<p>He has extensive experience working with multisite on a daily basis at CFTP. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t got many clients who don&#8217;t use multisite these days,&#8221; he said. When asked if there are any multisite improvements planned for 4.1, he said that there may not be much time to make significant strides on the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/10/06/potential-roadmap-for-multisite/" target="_blank">roadmap</a>.

In the 15 second video, featuring music from <a title="http://childishgambino.com/" href="http://childishgambino.com/">Childish Gambino</a>, photos are taken with a iPhone in various locations. Near the end of the video, the WordPress app is opened displaying a post with one of the images captured by the phone. The central theme of the video is to <strong>create your home on the web at <a title="http://wordpress.com/" href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a></strong>.</p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<p>My initial reaction to the video is that it puts too much emphasis on photos. It makes it seem like the WordPress app is only capable of sharing photos similar to <a title="https://www.flickr.com/" href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> or <a title="http://instagram.com/#" href="http://instagram.com/">Instagram</a>. A home on the web has more than just photos, something that doesn&#8217;t come across in the 15 second message.</p>\n<p>Something else I find odd is the choice to highlight the app versus WordPress.com. There&#8217;s no mention or video of the WordPress.com user interface or other aspects of the site. As WordPress.com likes to do, this video is likely an experiment but in my opinion, fails to deliver on their central message. It&#8217;s aimed at too narrow of an audience and doesn&#8217;t adequately show off what WordPress.com is truly capable of. Granted, we&#8217;re talking about 15 seconds of video which is why I&#8217;d like see what the team creates if given one minute to get the point across.</p>\n<p>Just for the sake of comparison, watch this SquareSpace ad. It&#8217;s a minute long, more to the point, and delivers on the message of creating a home on the web or in this case, creating your own space. The ad also does a good job of showing how the service can be used on various devices. When I watch this ad, I feel like people from all walks of life are able to easily create a site through SquareSpace.</p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<h2>Jon Burke Provides Context For The Video</h2>\n<p>In an effort not to cloud my judgement and reaction to the video, I reached out to Jon Burke, who works for Automattic, after publishing this post and received more information concerning the video.</p>\n<p><strong>Is the video actually a commercial or more or less an experiment?</strong></p>\n<p>WordPress.com has a freemium model and we run house ads. We have been running this video as a promotion on free sites. This video is part of a series. This video focuses on the utility of photos and the mobile apps. Other videos we are producing will focus on other aspects of WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>The video is brief for a couple of reasons. We don&#8217;t want to interrupt the site viewers&#8217; experience for too long and we wanted it to be viewable by our visitors where English is not the primary language.</p>\n<p>So it is a commercial, but we are also experimenting with different videos about WordPress.com to see how we can best get our message out in a way that is organic with the culture of Automattic and the WordPress community.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it aimed towards raising awareness of the WordPress mobile app or WordPress.com?</strong></p>\n<p>This video is focused on our mobile apps. The comparison to the SquareSpace video is a fair one but our ambition is to get our message across better in a dozen videos rather than in a single, longer video. We create a lot of products and have a number of services and don&#8217;t think we can cover it all well in a single short video.</p>\n<h2>Now It Makes Sense</h2>\n<p>The explanation provided by Burke provides the missing context surrounding the video. The video now makes perfect sense in that it&#8217;s part of a series with plans to produce more like it focusing on other areas of WordPress.com. This information completely changes my tune. Instead of failing to deliver the message, it&#8217;s on point.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 26 Sep 2014 20:02:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:94:"WPTavern: Ryan Hellyer’s AWS Nightmare: Leaked Access Keys Result in a $6,000 Bill Overnight";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=31497";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:98:"http://wptavern.com/ryan-hellyers-aws-nightmare-leaked-access-keys-result-in-a-6000-bill-overnight";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9568:"<p>WordPress developer <a href="http://geek.ryanhellyer.net/" target="_blank">Ryan Hellyer</a> had always wanted to open source his website. As a strong supporter of open source software and an avid plugin developer, he enjoys sharing his code and learning from others. This desire led him to put his site up on GitHub one evening, not knowing that he would wake to find himself in a security nightmare due to a simple oversight.</p>\n<p>Open sourcing a website is not such an uncommon practice, as it brings with it a number of benefits. Hellyer shared his story with the Tavern and identified the main reasons wanted to make his site&#8217;s code public on GitHub:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It allows people to see what plugins and themes I use</li>\n<li>It makes it super easy to get help with my website, since people can see the code</li>\n<li>It encourages me to use best practices across my entire website, not just the bits I post for download (custom plugins, themes etc.)</li>\n<li>It is a handy way to sync the files between locations</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>&#8220;I was aware that keeping my wp-config.php file off of GitHub was critical,&#8221;</strong> Hellyer said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Leaving that open for download would also make my database credentials, security salts etc. known to attackers. To mitigate this, I simply moved it one folder down (it still works even when it&#8217;s not in the root of your site). As a double protection, I also used the .gitignore file to forcibly prevent Git from pushing it to the repository.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Satisfied that his website was totally backed up and thinking that he had taken all the necessary security precautions, Hellyer pushed all the contents of his site (with the exception of the uploads directory) to a new GitHub repository. Pleased with his efforts, he dozed off to sleep.</p>\n<h3>An Urgent Message Arrives from Amazon</h3>\n<p>Not four hours later, Hellyer received an urgent message from Amazon, though he didn&#8217;t have the chance to read it until later in the morning.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I awoke fresh the next morning, began work for the day, then decided to check my personal email account and saw the email I had received overnight,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The email was marked URGENT.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hellyer initially thought it was spam but went with his instinct and opened it anyway, as it appeared to be fairly legitimate. Amazon emailed to notify him that his account may have been compromised.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I immediately went to check my AWS billing page, but thankfully it was only at US$17 for the month so far, which was about my normal usage,&#8221; he said, noting that he uses AWS (Amazon Web Services) for backing up to Amazon S3 and for providing a CDN service to his website (via Amazon Cloudfront).</p>\n<p>The email specifically asked him to check his EC2 instances, which Hellyer found to be odd, since he doesn&#8217;t even use Amazon EC2.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I checked anyway, and surprisingly, here were 80+ servers running. I thought &#8216;OHHH CRAP!&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;So I shut them all down. Problem solved I thought, and since my bill was still looking normal I figured it wasn&#8217;t a problem.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ten minutes later Hellyer discovers another 80+ servers running at a different location on EC2. Digging deeper, he found five more locations, all with 80+ servers running. After fully auditing his account, he found more sections of &#8220;reserved instances&#8221; with even more servers running.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;In total, there seemed to be around 600 servers running. The time between realizing all this and uploading my Git repository was approximately 12 hours.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<h3>Digging Out of a Hole</h3>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/emergency.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[31497]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/emergency.jpg?resize=1024%2C482" alt="photo credit: Code & Martini by Ivana Vasilj - cc license" class="size-full wp-image-21873" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://flic.kr/p/dLUWMb">Code &#038; Martini</a> by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ivanavasilj/">Ivana Vasilj</a> &#8211; cc license\n<p>Hellyer went into damage control mode, scrambling to find the source of the problem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My immediate thought was &#8216;YOU IDIOT! You didn&#8217;t remove the wp-config.php file which contains AWS access keys!&#8217; he said. &#8220;But I went to check the repository, and it was not there. It turned out though, that there was another file called &#8216;wp-config.php.save,&#8217; which DID contain my AWS access keys.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That file also contained his database password and security salts, but so far he hasn&#8217;t found any indication that the site was compromised by those. Hellyer immediately changed the password and swapped out the config keys.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;But those horrid little AWS access keys were sitting on the repository in view of everyone. I immediately deleted the entire repository from GitHub.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it took him two hours to delete all of the Amazon EC2 instances created by the exploited keys. &#8220;The evil little blighters had cranked up the security protection and actually made it very awkward to shut them all down,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t able to just terminate them and in fact had to go through one by one and manually turn off termination protection, then stop them, then terminate them. Then I had to go through and delete many volumes which had been setup (I think this is the EC2 equivalent of a drive).&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Hellyer is Slapped with a $6,000 Bill for Unauthorized Usage</h3>\n<p>AWS bills don&#8217;t update in real time, and Hellyer&#8217;s bill still read $17 USD. After contacting support to find out the damage, he saw his bill jump from $17 to $3,087.97. AWS was helpful throughout the process and give him a list of tasks to complete, including deleting some hidden EC2 instances which had not previously been visible in the console.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After doing all of this, I went to take a snapshot of the billing statement to show everyone my lovely US$3,087.97 bill, only to find it had shot up to US$5994.08 in the meantime,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/aws-bill.png" rel="prettyphoto[31497]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/aws-bill.png?resize=425%2C554" alt="aws-bill" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31503" /></a></p>\n<p>Amazon followed up with the following note:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve submitted a concession request for the unauthorized usage charges you incurred for the current month. The concession request requires approval from levels of management therefore the process can take up to 7 &#8211; 10 working days to complete.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He&#8217;s hoping that the leaked keys will not result in him having to cough up $6K for unauthorized use, but he hasn&#8217;t yet received confirmation that he won&#8217;t be held responsible.</p>\n<h3>Why were his AWS Credentials in his wp-config file?</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been following along with this nightmare situation, you may be wondering why Hellyer was storing his AWS credentials in wp-config.php. This was required for the <a href="http://geek.ryanhellyer.net/products/photocopy/">Photocopy</a> plugin he released a few years ago. There are many other plugins that utilize this same method. Although the plugin didn&#8217;t seem to have any security flaws, he decided to remove it from the site and discontinue development due to the unpleasant experience of having his keys leaked. &#8220;The only other option is store it in the database, but I think that&#8217;s actually worse as you would run into exactly the same problem if your database were leaked,&#8221; Hellyer said.</p>\n<h3>Keep Your Keys Safe and Private</h3>\n<p>This cautionary tale should serve as a reminder to keep your keys safe and private. Hellyer unknowingly sabotaged himself when trying to open source the code for his site and learned an expensive lesson:</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Not only should you be extremely careful with your usernames, passwords, plugin and theme security etc., but you need to be even more careful about credentials for services which cost money,&#8221;</strong> he advised.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather see my blog(s) hacked than to have this happen again. Hacked sites can be easily fixed. Deleted data can be restored. A $6000 bill however is something else entirely,&#8221; Hellyer said. He also noted that if the exploit had just been a few extra dollars here and there, it could have quietly leached his account indefinitely without him noticing. As it was, if Amazon hadn&#8217;t issued him an urgent notice, he probably wouldn&#8217;t have noticed until he received a $100,000 bill at the end of the month.</p>\n<p>The lesson here is that if you can avoid having to store AWS credentials in wp-config.php, by all means, find another way. What started out as a well-meaning effort to open source his site, quickly became a horrible nightmare that has yet to reach a conclusion. There are people out there ready and willing to exploit stolen or leaked AWS keys, and they clearly have a sophisticated way of scouring the web to find them.</p>\n<p>Hellyer sums it up: <strong>&#8220;Long story short &#8230; don&#8217;t do stupid stuff with publicly accessible code. Also, don&#8217;t store your AWS credentials unless you absolutely have to.&#8221;</strong></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 26 Sep 2014 16:38:22 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:25:"Matt: Faith in Eventually";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44158";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"http://ma.tt/2014/09/faith-in-eventually/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:659:"<blockquote><p>During the development of most any product, there are always times when things aren’t quite right.

Anyone that has ever gone through that process understands the complexities and challenges.</p>\n<p>Frankly put, it’s been something we identified as a potential risk and are working rapidly now to rectify this issue as fast as humanly possible.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that their customer database and iThemes.com users were affected, but customers that use their Sync product to manage their own websites were not. So if you use iThemes Sync, and utilized your site passwords to connect, those accounts and passwords were not part of this breach.</p>\n<h3>aMember and legacy membership platforms</h3>\n<p>The membership platform that Cory highlights in the update is a<a href="http://www.amember.com/">Member</a>, a membership management system that&#8217;s been around for many years. aMember only introduced <a href="http://www.amember.com/p/2011/11/amember-pro-version-4-stable/">encrypted passwords in version 4</a>, which was released in November of 2011.</p>\n<p>I discussed aMember and plaintext passwords with some other folks that have a significant history with the membership platform, and there are some significant problems that anyone using aMember have experienced.</p>\n<p>First, most folks heavily using aMember aren&#8217;t using it out of the box. At the time, most membership sites were doing significant customizations to aMember to achieve desired functionality. So when the v.4 update came out, it was a very difficult update procedure for people to take advantage of the features.</p>\n<p>iThemes would even tell you that their current version of membership software doesn&#8217;t look much like aMember at all.</p>\n<p>iThemes is also not the first to be hacked and their aMember passwords leaked. Tuts+ Premium <a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/general/tuts-premium-security/">had the same issue in 2012</a>.</p>\n<p>I discussed aMember at length with <a href="http://twitter.com/pippinsplugins">Pippin Williamson</a>. He has done a lot of work on his brother&#8217;s membership site, <a href="http://cgcookie.com/">CGCookie</a>, which also used aMember until 2012, when he did a huge migration of tens of thousands of members to a new platform.</p>\n<p>At the time, Pippin notes that aMember did not disclose passwords were stored in plaintext, so CGCookie had no idea that their users were vulnerable until they learned of the Tuts+ hack, wherein they put a planned migration &#8220;into hyperdrive.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The problem with iThemes&#8217; situation is that they knew of the plaintext passwords and didn&#8217;t address the obvious security vulnerability.</p>\n<p>All in all, the migration for CGCookie took months to perfect and significant juggling of priorities by their team.</p>\n<h3>Ticking time bomb</h3>\n<p>Speaking with Pippin, migrating from aMember was not an easy task. Paypal&#8217;s IPN handlers (a payment notification system) were tightly linked to aMember and preventing customer accounts from being disconnected from the membership site took weeks of engineering. Additionally, simply upgrading to the newer versions was also terrible.</p>\n<p>Many other WordPress companies have used aMember in the past as well, storing plaintext passwords just like iThemes today.</p>\n<p>So, aMember has definitely been a problem before now, but iThemes has absolutely slacked in their prioritization of the issue. Simply put, it&#8217;s inexcusable to put users into long term risk if you know their passwords are stored in plaintext.<span id="more-7134"></span></p>\n<p>That said, we should consider the potential consequences &#8212; though it doesn&#8217;t make it excusable. Because iThemes doesn&#8217;t store credit card details, emails and names and passwords are about the worst things at risk. Still, a tiny percentage of the general population uses responsible passwords, so getting a list of names and emails and passwords is a treasure trove of information for third party (as in other websites like banks and email providers) to steal identities and break directly into user accounts.</p>\n<p>This should also be a significant lesson for any user to always use different passwords for every website where you keep an account. Tools like <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> and <a href="https://agilebits.com/">1Password</a> make account password management easy. Additionally, learn about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-step_verification">2-factor authentication</a> and use it whenever the service enables it.</p>\n<h3>Owning mistakes</h3>\n<p>This is clearly a horrible situation for iThemes to be in. Users have a right to be mad. In 2014 we should be able to expect that our passwords are encrypted, and that even if a server where our information is stored is hacked, that certain valuable details like credit cards or passwords are not exposed. Thankfully, iThemes doesn&#8217;t store credit card details, but those passwords should now be assumed stolen, and users have to pay that price.</p>\n<p>But where I have enormous respect for iThemes is how they have owned it. Especially in the update post, Cory Miller &#8212; iThemes&#8217; founder and CEO &#8212; took ownership of the issue and told the full story of the breach.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I realize this will generate a lot of concern. Again, I am deeply sorry for this mistake and how it has affected you.</p>\n<p>Let me say: we have made mistakes in the past at iThemes … and as humans will make mistakes in the future. To make a promise otherwise would be absurd and misleading.</p>\n<p><strong>But my promise to you, our customers, is this</strong> … and it’s the same promise that I’ve held to since January 2008 when I started iThemes in my home:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>We will identify mistakes as best we can.</strong> You have helped us with this and appreciate that accountability.</li>\n<li><strong>We will own up to our mistakes.</strong> Again, we’ve done this in the past, we did this yesterday and this post is another example of us living this value.</li>\n<li><strong>We will fix the mistake as fast as humanly possible.</strong> A number of priority issues have been unearthed, shone a hard light on, but we are working to resolve them.</li>\n<li><strong>We will learn and grow from it and be better for it and for you.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Additionally, as the founder and CEO, the leader of this company, I want you to know: <strong>the buck stops with me and me alone.</strong></p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I am responsible for our company, iThemes, and the work we do. I’ve often tried to defer credit for the great work we’ve done to our team, but as for the mistakes we make, that credit belongs solely to me.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Not every company that&#8217;s been breached can say the same. Even huge organizations (I&#8217;m thinking of Home Depot as the latest) have done a horrible job at responsible and honest disclosure to their customers.</p>\n<p>iThemes could have made this much more quiet and kept it from being a priority to their users or a big deal in WordPress news-land. But they didn&#8217;t. They owned it, they apologized, and they&#8217;ve been rewarded for that.</p>\n<p>In the comments of the security update post, users were appalled by the lack of responsibility on the security priorities, but the honesty paid off in the sense that users were verbally thankful for it so that they could accept the problem and deal with it, when the alternative was to be in the dark.</p>\n<p>While this breach has cost iThemes some credibility, and some trust, I believe those things are recoverable. Had they obfuscated the hack itself, my post and users reactions (had they found out) would be very different.</p>\n<h3>What iThemes is doing now</h3>\n<p>iThemes has learned a hard lesson this week, as many other companies have before them. Now they must react, and react strongly. In a situation like this, nothing should take priority over getting this issue fixed.</p>\n<p>Until they get their password storage issue fixed, they still are storing passwords in plaintext, even the new ones. Thankfully they&#8217;ve already updated password restrictions &#8212; which previously limited passwords to 20 characters &#8212; to now accept up to 255 characters. But storing them in plaintext means that they are still as vulnerable today as they were last week if someone gets into the server again. So they must be absolutely vigilant to protect their servers through this migration.</p>\n<h3>What we can all learn</h3>\n<p>Security is not a sexy industry. Too often we don&#8217;t consider it until it&#8217;s a problem. &#8220;Going on offense&#8221; should be our default when we consider security actions, but more often &#8212; even with some of the best companies and people in the tech space &#8212; we react to issues and aren&#8217;t appropriately proactive.</p>\n<p>That said, our job is not done either. All of us should consider our own security situation and how we can improve it. Especially if you have users of your own (and many of my readers do), consider that state of your own security, and make sure it&#8217;s a priority in your business.</p>\n<p>When we think about what pays the bills, it&#8217;s not security awareness and proactive security investments. But we should consider security breaches and vulnerabilities as risks that must be managed; meaning investment into security priorities should be a significant part of any business.</p>\n<p>iThemes, Envato, and WooThemes are all &#8220;big&#8221; businesses from a WordPress business perspective. Each of them has fought a website security battle. Envato and WooThemes before iThemes have recovered and maintained their users and the community&#8217;s trust. I think iThemes will too. But before you, or me, decide &#8220;it won&#8217;t happen to us&#8221;, consider that it can happen to anyone, and our investments into security measures and best practices are not only worthwhile, but the only responsible thing to do.</p>\n<p>And for users, use different passwords on every site. Use LastPass or 1Password. Enable 2-factor authentication. Be vigilant. Do not use the excuse that it&#8217;s too hard or a burden. What&#8217;s much more of a burden is dealing with a hacked email or bank account. Protect yourself and learn how to protect your accounts. It&#8217;s easy to adjust to and modern tools make it a much simpler task to manage.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s all &#8212; web professionals and users &#8212; learn with iThemes here, and do better.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 25 Sep 2014 20:01:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"WPTavern: iThemes Confirms it Stored Customer Passwords in Clear-Text";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=31475";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"http://wptavern.com/ithemes-confirms-it-stored-customer-passwords-in-clear-text";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4658:"<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ClearTextPasswordFeaturedImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[31475]"><img class="size-full wp-image-31477" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ClearTextPasswordFeaturedImage.png?resize=637%2C200" alt="Clear Text Password" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/thegloaming/1402099967/">thegloaming</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>The CEO of iThemes, Cory Miller, <a title="http://ithemes.com/2014/09/25/update-2-security-update-for-ithemes-customers/" href="http://ithemes.com/2014/09/25/update-2-security-update-for-ithemes-customers/">published a second update</a> concerning the <a title="http://wptavern.com/ithemes-suffers-security-breach-customers-urged-to-reset-passwords" href="http://wptavern.com/ithemes-suffers-security-breach-customers-urged-to-reset-passwords">security breach</a> that occurred on Tuesday. After news of the breach, <a title="http://ithemes.com/2014/09/23/important-security-update-for-all-customers/comment-page-1/#comment-100073" href="http://ithemes.com/2014/09/23/important-security-update-for-all-customers/comment-page-1/#comment-100073">customers were left wondering</a> whether or not their passwords were stored in clear-text. The latest update confirms that passwords were in fact stored in clear-text and affected approximately 60,000 customers.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There is no easy way to say this: We were storing your passwords in clear-text. This directly impacted approximately 60,000 of our users, past and current.</p>\n<p>Yes, those credentials were used across our entire platform, from our iThemes membership login to your iThemes Sync login.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Passwords stored in clear-text allow hackers to easily obtain them if the database becomes compromised. According to the announcement, storing passwords in clear-text dates back to membership software used in 2009. Since that time, the company has been involved with a large migration process moving from legacy systems to newer technology.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Know that it’s not because we did not value your data. As an organization, we have been working on a very large migration process that has required us to interlink legacy systems with the latest technologies. Anyone that has ever gone through that process understands the complexities and challenges.</p>\n<p>Frankly put, it’s been something we identified as a potential risk and are working rapidly now to rectify this issue as fast as humanly possible.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I asked the CTO of <a title="http://crowdfavorite.com/" href="http://crowdfavorite.com/">CrowdFavorite</a>, <a title="http://chrislema.com/" href="http://chrislema.com/">Chris Lema</a>, who has over 20 years of experience in enterprise and SaaS products, if what iThemes experienced is common. &#8220;I can tell you this isn&#8217;t the first or last time I&#8217;ve heard of legacy systems that needed to be migrated or code that needed to be refactored. Sometimes you do it before anything bad happens. Sometimes you&#8217;re not fast enough. The trick is to prioritize it, even when things are &#8216;<em>working&#8217;</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In order to avoid the issues iThemes is working through, Lema offers the following advice. &#8220;Companies that have legacy systems &#8211; especially membership sites or eCommerce sites with users/passwords need to create a strategy for migrating those old systems while keeping everything running. This often means the creation of several interim systems. In other words, the migration isn&#8217;t a straight path but a multi-stop journey.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Honesty is a Virtue</h2>\n<p>Customers <a title="http://ithemes.com/2014/09/25/update-2-security-update-for-ithemes-customers/comment-page-1/#comment-100191" href="http://ithemes.com/2014/09/25/update-2-security-update-for-ithemes-customers/comment-page-1/#comment-100191">have expressed disappointment</a> that a company who sells one of the most popular WordPress security plugins failed to adhere to security best practices. However, thanks to Miller&#8217;s honest approach of attacking the issue head on, a lot of those same customers are pledging their support.</p>\n<p>Although this is a difficult situation for iThemes and its customers, the way Miller has handled the situation is an excellent example of leadership. The easiest thing to do in situations like these is to sweep it under the rug or go around the issue. While customers have every right to be outraged, Miller&#8217;s human and honest approach has kept a backlash to a minimum.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 25 Sep 2014 16:22:45 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"WPTavern: A New Resource Devoted To WordPress and Photographers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=29165";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://wptavern.com/a-new-resource-devoted-to-wordpress-and-photographers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2079:"<p><a title="http://wp-photographers.com/" href="http://wp-photographers.com/">WP Photographers,</a> is a new resource created by Aaron Hockley, to help photographers and WordPress users share their photos and build photography businesses.

With a subscription based business, capturing early product sales and managing risks to retain those customers have an important role in generating futures sales.</p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1"><b>How can you accelerate early sales and retain customers? </b></p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1">It starts with introducing your solution in an appropriate way and engaging trusted, local influencers to build credibility.</p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1">We have a framework of <b>5 Customer Funnels</b> you can use to follow the customer through their product journey and ideas on how you can bring them along each step of the way (Figure 1).</p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1"><b>5 Customer Funnels</b></p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n\r\n<ul class="ul1">\r\n	<li class="li1"><b>Acquisition</b> – People come to your site after they’ve heard about you through email, press, blogs, word of mouth, and other paid or unpaid channels.</li>\r\n	<li class="li1"><b>Activation</b> – If people like what they see on the landing page, email invitation, app store or other form of advertising they’ll become users by creating an account and beginning   their free trial.</li>\r\n	<li class="li1"><b>Retention</b> – Users come back to the app through unsolicited use, emails reminders or push notifications and stay active through features they encounter while using the product.</li>\r\n	<li class="li1"><b>Revenue</b> – You monetize active users through paid subscriptions.</li>\r\n	<li class="li1"><b>Referral</b> – Active users refer others through viral product features and other incentives.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1"><b>Figure 1</b></p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1">Let’s take a deeper dive into each of these.</p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1"><b>Acquisition &amp; Activation</b></p>\r\n<p class="p1">This is all about getting customers interested in what you have to offer (acquisition) and getting them to begin the trial (activation). Prior to actually acquiring customers, you’ll want to answer some questions to help refine messaging for the product.</p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1">To begin, let’s define the value proposition – the primary reason a customer should buy from you.  Once defined, this is first thing visitors should see on the landing page and all major entry points.</p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1">Answers (from people who could become real customers) on a few basic questions can help to determine the language of your customer and further define your value proposition.</p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n\r\n<ul class="ul1">\r\n	<li class="li1">How can I save or acquire more time/money/information using this product?</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">How can improve my perceived worth/quality in front of my clients/peers?</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">How can I feel personally rewarded?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1">Examples of product features/benefits and opportunities from these 3 questions include the following:</p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How can I save or acquire more time/money/information using this product?</span></p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1">Pre-choreographed music and workouts saves you time.</p>\r\n<p class="p1">Less expensive than DVD’s</p>\r\n<p class="p1">Access content only available here</p>\r\n<p class="p1">Teach classes anywhere</p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How can improve my perceived worth/quality in front of my clients/peers?</span></p>\r\n<p class="p1">Content updated regularly to keep classes fresh</p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How can I feel personally rewarded?</span></p>\r\n<p class="p1">Early access to events</p>\r\n<p class="p1">Exclusive offers/promotions</p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1">On your product landing page then, the value proposition is usually a block of text (a headline, sub-headline and one paragraph of text) with a visual (photo, hero shot, graphics).</p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1">There is no one right way to go about it, but I suggest you start with the following formula:</p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n\r\n<ul class="ul1">\r\n	<li class="li1">Headline. What is the end-benefit you’re offering, in 1 short sentence.  An attention grabber.</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">Sub-headline or a 2-3 sentence paragraph. A specific explanation of what you do/offer, for whom and why is it useful.</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">3 bullet points. List the key benefits or features.</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">Visual. Images communicate much faster than words. Show the product, the hero shot or an image reinforcing your main message.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Solve their objections</span></p>\r\n<p class="p1">Next, make it easy for them to begin. Supporting value add-copy can help reduce reasons a customer may not purchase or begin a trial.  Examples include:</p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n\r\n<ul class="ul1">\r\n	<li class="li1">Free trial</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">Monthly to Month agreement, cancel any time</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">Money-back guarantee</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">Limited time discount</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1">Demonstrating the actual, tangible solution is often the best way to introduce something new. Every new solution can benefit from a well-designed demonstration. The free trial along with a video tutorial or other interactive content helps show which aspects of your solution pose the biggest perceived risk to your customer.</p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1">On top of this, other marketing activities to consider include the following:</p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n\r\n<ul class="ul1">\r\n	<li class="li1">Landing page optimization\r\n<ul class="ul1">\r\n	<li class="li1">Making the product simple to purchase and easy to try before they buy.</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">Creating a remarkable customer experience through design and content.</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">Creating a separate product landing page to accurately track and manage.</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">Site A/B Testing to optimize copy and design.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">Email\r\n<ul class="ul1">\r\n	<li class="li1">Testing email campaigns to optimize conversion</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">Evaluating open, click thru and conversion rates</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">Auto-responder if cart abandonment</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">Automate remarketing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">SEO\r\n<ul class="ul1">\r\n	<li class="li1">Capture interested potential customers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">Content Marketing\r\n<ul class="ul1">\r\n	<li class="li1">Leveraging blog posts, infographics, and videos to increase awareness and site traffic</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">Paid Acquisition\r\n<ul class="ul1">\r\n	<li class="li1">Search engine marketing (Google AdWords; Facebook ads; display ads; mobile ads).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1">Next, establish credibility by aligning customer influencers.

It is important to look for points where you can influence the natural process to accelerate widespread adoption and to provide easy ways for people to talk and share about the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class="ul1">\r\n	<li class="li1">Building buzz: recommendations &amp; referrals</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">Encourage users to share through social media</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">Sales reps and industry partners</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1"><b>Where to begin</b></p>\r\n<p class="p1">It’s impossible to focus your efforts on each of these steps at the same time.  Choose one of the five funnels and focus relentlessly on improving, then reassess and begin again. We recommend a 5 Step process for considerations when planning your efforts.</p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n\r\n<ul class="ul1">\r\n	<li class="li1">Prioritize the plan. What are the 1 or 2 metrics we want to improve?</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">List our intent. Why do we want to change?</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">List the customer friction to solve. What’s the user experience problem?</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">Determine baseline conversion. What is the current status?</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">Consider potential lift from test. How much do we expect to gain?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1">As an example, let’s assume we are in the acquisition phase and we’ve already emailed an invitation to begin the free trial to a portion of the potential customer list.  We’ve noticed the open rates of the email are lower than expected.</p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1">Going through the 5 Steps is as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class="ul1">\r\n	<li class="li1">We want to improve email open rates</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">To increase the number of people who have the opportunity to begin a free trial</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">They aren’t finding the subject line compelling enough to open</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">Current open rates are 20%</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">Expect a 10% lift with a change to the subject line</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1">Or, another example would be this:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class="ul1">\r\n	<li class="li1">We want to improve the number of site visits to the app landing page from people not on our mailing list.</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">To increase the number of people who have the opportunity to experience our brand and begin a free trial</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">People outside of our permission marketing channels aren’t aware of what the app</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">Current organic site visits account for 5% of traffic</li>\r\n	<li class="li1">Request our current users to rate the app in the app store will improve the app ranking and increase organic site visits to 7.5% within 45 days.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1">While having a great product is the most important success factor, a methodical and persistent approach to optimizing the customer funnels will further accelerate sales.</p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>', 'Simple Framework to Accelerate Revenue', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '248-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-08-12 06:52:33', '2014-08-12 06:52:33', '', 248, 'http://localhost/248-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The more DVD’s you produce and sell the more you’ll save by going digital. Still want DVD’s? Consider charging a higher price for the DVD as an incentive to for customers to move to a digital solution. Not only will you get a greater margin if they buy the DVD, you’ll also add to your Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) if they buy a subscription.  MRR is a key success metric in subscription based businesses.</p>\r\n<p class="p2"></p>\r\n<p class="p1"><b>Eliminate Piracy</b></p>\r\n<p class="p1">Illegal copies of DVD’s cost companies millions of dollars per year in both lost sales and the legal cost of battling counterfeit problems. You won’t have this problem with streaming video.

The more DVD’s you produce and sell the more you’ll save by going digital. Still want DVD’s? Consider charging a higher price for the DVD as an incentive to for customers to move to a digital solution. Not only will you get a greater margin if they buy the DVD, you’ll also add to your Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) if they buy a subscription.  MRR is a key success metric in subscription based businesses.\n\nEliminate Piracy\n\nIllegal copies of DVD’s cost companies millions of dollars per year in both lost sales and the legal cost of battling counterfeit problems. You won’t have this problem with streaming video. While our platform allows a mobile app to be installed on more than one device, the content can only be played on one device at a time, making sharing of content unlikely.\n\nUpdate your content easily\n\nThe Classcast platform includes a Content Management tool so you can update your content anytime you want.

The more DVD’s you produce and sell the more you’ll save by going digital. Still want DVD’s? Consider charging a higher price for the DVD as an incentive to for customers to move to a digital solution. Not only will you get a greater margin if they buy the DVD, you’ll also add to your Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) if they buy a subscription.  MRR is a key success metric in subscription based businesses.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>Eliminate Piracy</strong>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nIllegal copies of DVD’s cost companies millions of dollars per year in both lost sales and the legal cost of battling counterfeit problems. You won’t have this problem with streaming video. While our platform allows a mobile app to be installed on more than one device, the content can only be played on one device at a time, making sharing of content unlikely.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>Update your content easily</strong>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe Classcast platform includes a Content Management tool so you can update your content anytime you want.

With a subscription based business, capturing early product sales and managing risks to retain those customers have an important role in generating futures sales.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>How can you accelerate early sales and retain customers?</strong>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nIt starts with introducing your solution in an appropriate way and engaging trusted, local influencers to build credibility.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nWe have a framework of <strong>5 Customer Funnels</strong> you can use to follow the customer through their product journey and ideas on how you can bring them along each step of the way (Figure 1).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>5 Customer Funnels</strong>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Acquisition</strong> – People come to your site after they’ve heard about you through email, press, blogs, word of mouth, and other paid or unpaid channels.</li>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n	<li><strong>Activation</strong> – If people like what they see on the landing page, email invitation, app store or other form of advertising they’ll become users by creating an account and beginning   their free trial.</li>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n	<li><strong>Retention</strong> – Users come back to the app through unsolicited use, emails reminders or push notifications and stay active through features they encounter while using the product.</li>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n	<li><strong>Revenue</strong> – You monetize active users through paid subscriptions.</li>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n	<li><strong>Referral</strong> – Active users refer others through viral product features and other incentives.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nFigure 1\r\n&nbsp;\r\nLet’s take a deeper dive into each of these.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>Acquisition &amp; Activation</strong>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThis is all about getting customers interested in what you have to offer (acquisition) and getting them to begin the trial (activation). Prior to actually acquiring customers, you’ll want to answer some questions to help refine messaging for the product.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nTo begin, let’s define the value proposition – the primary reason a customer should buy from you.  Once defined, this is first thing visitors should see on the landing page and all major entry points.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAnswers (from people who could become real customers) on a few basic questions can help to determine the language of your customer and further define your value proposition.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>How can I save or acquire more time/money/information using this product?</li>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n	<li>How can improve my perceived worth/quality in front of my clients/peers?</li>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n	<li>How can I feel personally rewarded?</li>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n</ol>\r\nExamples of product features/benefits and opportunities from these 3 questions include the following:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How can I save or acquire more time/money/information using this product?</strong>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nPre-choreographed music and workouts saves you time.\r\n\r\nLess expensive than DVD’s\r\n\r\nAccess content only available here\r\n\r\nTeach classes anywhere\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>How can improve my perceived worth/quality in front of my clients/peers?</strong>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nContent updated regularly to keep classes fresh\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>How can I feel personally rewarded?</strong>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nEarly access to events\r\n\r\nExclusive offers/promotions\r\n&nbsp;\r\nOn your product landing page then, the value proposition is usually a block of text (a headline, sub-headline and one paragraph of text) with a visual (photo, hero shot, graphics).\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThere is no one right way to go about it, but I suggest you start with the following formula:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Headline. What is the end-benefit you’re offering, in 1 short sentence.  An attention grabber.</li>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n	<li>Sub-headline or a 2-3 sentence paragraph. A specific explanation of what you do/offer, for whom and why is it useful.</li>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n	<li>3 bullet points. List the key benefits or features.</li>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n	<li>Visual. Images communicate much faster than words. Show the product, the hero shot or an image reinforcing your main message.</li>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Solve their objections</strong>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nNext, make it easy for them to begin.

With a subscription based business, capturing early product sales and managing risks to retain those customers have an important role in generating futures sales\r\n\r\n<strong>How can you accelerate early sales and retain customers?</strong>\r\n\r\nIt starts with introducing your solution in an appropriate way and engaging trusted, local influencers to build credibility.\r\n\r\nWe have a framework of <strong>5 Customer Funnels</strong> you can use to follow the customer through their product journey and ideas on how you can bring them along each step of the way (Figure 1).\r\n\r\n<strong>5 Customer Funnels</strong>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Acquisition</strong> – People come to your site after they’ve heard about you through email, press, blogs, word of mouth, and other paid or unpaid channels.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Activation</strong> – If people like what they see on the landing page, email invitation, app store or other form of advertising they’ll become users by creating an account and beginning their free trial.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Retention</strong> – Users come back to the app through unsolicited use, emails reminders or push notifications and stay active through features they encounter while using the product.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Revenue</strong> – You monetize active users through paid subscriptions.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Referral</strong> – Active users refer others through viral product features and other incentives.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class="aligncenter" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/figure_1.png" alt="" width="551" height="293" />\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Figure 1</strong></em></p>\r\nLet’s take a deeper dive into each of these.\r\n\r\n<strong>Acquisition &amp; Activation</strong>\r\n\r\nThis is all about getting customers interested in what you have to offer (acquisition) and getting them to begin the trial (activation). Prior to actually acquiring customers, you’ll want to answer some questions to help refine messaging for the product.\r\n\r\nTo begin, let’s define the value proposition – the primary reason a customer should buy from you. Once defined, this is first thing visitors should see on the landing page and all major entry points.\r\n\r\nAnswers (from people who could become real customers) on a few basic questions can help to determine the language of your customer and further define your value proposition.\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>How can I save or acquire more time/money/information using this product?</li>\r\n	<li>How can improve my perceived worth/quality in front of my clients/peers?</li>\r\n	<li>How can I feel personally rewarded?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nExamples of product features/benefits and opportunities from these 3 questions include the following:\r\n\r\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;">How can I save or acquire more time/money/information using this product?</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Pre-choreographed music and workouts saves you time.</li>\r\n	<li>Less expensive than DVD’s</li>\r\n	<li>Access content only available here</li>\r\n	<li>Teach classes anywhere</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;">How can improve my perceived worth/quality in front of my clients/peers?</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Content updated regularly to keep classes fresh</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;">How can I feel personally rewarded?</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Early access to events</li>\r\n	<li>Exclusive offers/promotions</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOn your product landing page then, the value proposition is usually a block of text (a headline, sub-headline and one paragraph of text) with a visual (photo, hero shot, graphics).\r\n\r\nThere is no one right way to go about it, but I suggest you start with the following formula:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Headline. What is the end-benefit you’re offering, in 1 short sentence. An attention grabber.</li>\r\n	<li>Sub-headline or a 2-3 sentence paragraph. A specific explanation of what you do/offer, for whom and why is it useful.</li>\r\n	<li>3 bullet points. List the key benefits or features.</li>\r\n	<li>Visual. Images communicate much faster than words. Show the product, the hero shot or an image reinforcing your main message.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Solve their objections</span>\r\n\r\nNext, make it easy for them to begin. Supporting value add-copy can help reduce reasons a customer may not purchase or begin a trial. Examples include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Free trial</li>\r\n	<li>Monthly to Month agreement, cancel any time</li>\r\n	<li>Money-back guarantee</li>\r\n	<li>Limited time discount</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDemonstrating the actual, tangible solution is often the best way to introduce something new. Every new solution can benefit from a well-designed demonstration. The free trial along with a video tutorial or other interactive content helps show which aspects of your solution pose the biggest perceived risk to your customer.\r\n\r\nOn top of this, other marketing activities to consider include the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Landing page optimization\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Making the product simple to purchase and easy to try before they buy.</li>\r\n	<li>Creating a remarkable customer experience through design and content.</li>\r\n	<li>Creating a separate product landing page to accurately track and manage.</li>\r\n	<li>Site A/B Testing to optimize copy and design.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li>Email\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Testing email campaigns to optimize conversion</li>\r\n	<li>Evaluating open, click thru and conversion rates</li>\r\n	<li>Auto-responder if cart abandonment</li>\r\n	<li>Automate remarketing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li>SEO\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Capture interested potential customers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li>Content Marketing\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Leveraging blog posts, infographics, and videos to increase awareness and site traffic</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li>Paid Acquisition\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Search engine marketing (Google AdWords; Facebook ads; display ads; mobile ads).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNext, establish credibility by aligning customer influencers. Who do your customers listen to in the your industry?\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Get their early buy-in, familiarization with the product and recognize them for their importance to the company.</li>\r\n	<li>Selective extended trials (a full year) exchange for testimonials. Capture written and video testimonials about the benefits of the program</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n	<li>Social Media\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Have a coordinated/scripted social medial messaging and cadence developed for their use.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Retention:</strong>\r\n\r\nThe number one goal is to have customer retention. Successfully solving a customer’s problem and continuing to engage them enables a long-standing relationship to develop.\r\n\r\nEngagement is built into the product, as this is a critical component to long-term program success.\r\n\r\nSome goals with retention are to maintain the buzz and excitement of the product and deepen the connection with the community of subscribers.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Live conversations\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Speaking with a small number of active customers and those who cancelled. Provides great feedback about what is working well and more importantly what needs to be improved.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li>Surveys\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Use tools including Survey Monkey and Net Promoter Score (a good leading indicator of other metrics) to measure their willingness to refer the product and affinity for existing or proposed features.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li>Email/Push\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Auto-responder emails are built into our platform based on user interaction with the app.</li>\r\n	<li>Push notifications with content updates and encourage social sharing</li>\r\n	<li>Exclusive member newsletter or email communication and promotions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong> Revenue:</strong>\r\n\r\nWith a simple monthly subscription and reasonable rates there’s not much do here. If you are having issues with retention it’s either a product or pricing problem.\r\n\r\nCommunicating with customers is a sure way to find our what they want from the product.\r\n\r\n<strong>Referral:</strong>\r\n\r\nWith any great solution, this will happen naturally, but probably not as quickly as you would like. It is important to look for points where you can influence the natural process to accelerate widespread adoption and to provide easy ways for people to talk and share about the program.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Building buzz: recommendations &amp; referrals</li>\r\n	<li>Encourage users to share through social media</li>\r\n	<li>Sales reps and industry partners</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong> Where to begin</strong>\r\n\r\nIt’s impossible to focus your efforts on each of these steps at the same time. Choose one of the five funnels and focus relentlessly on improving, then reassess and begin again. We recommend a 5 Step process for considerations when planning your efforts.\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Prioritize the plan. What are the 1 or 2 metrics we want to improve?</li>\r\n	<li>List our intent. Why do we want to change?</li>\r\n	<li>List the customer friction to solve. What’s the user experience problem?</li>\r\n	<li>Determine baseline conversion. What is the current status?</li>\r\n	<li>Consider potential lift from test. How much do we expect to gain?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nAs an example, let’s assume we are in the acquisition phase and we’ve already emailed an invitation to begin the free trial to a portion of the potential customer list. We’ve noticed the open rates of the email are lower than expected.\r\n\r\nGoing through the 5 Steps is as follows:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>We want to improve email open rates</li>\r\n	<li>To increase the number of people who have the opportunity to begin a free trial</li>\r\n	<li>They aren’t finding the subject line compelling enough to open</li>\r\n	<li>Current open rates are 20%</li>\r\n	<li>Expect a 10% lift with a change to the subject line</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nOr, another example would be this:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>We want to improve the number of site visits to the app landing page from people not on our mailing list.</li>\r\n	<li>To increase the number of people who have the opportunity to experience our brand and begin a free trial</li>\r\n	<li>People outside of our permission marketing channels aren’t aware of what the app</li>\r\n	<li>Current organic site visits account for 5% of traffic</li>\r\n	<li>Request our current users to rate the app in the app store will improve the app ranking and increase organic site visits to 7.5% within 45 days.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhile having a great product is the most important success factor, a methodical and persistent approach to optimizing the customer funnels will further accelerate sales.', 'Simple Framework to Accelerate Revenue', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'simple-framework-accelerate-revenue', '', '', '2014-08-15 02:44:06', '2014-08-15 02:44:06', '', 0, 'http://staging.classcast.co/?p=300', 0, 'post', '', 0);

With a subscription based business, capturing early product sales and managing risks to retain those customers have an important role in generating futures sales.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>How can you accelerate early sales and retain customers?</strong>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nIt starts with introducing your solution in an appropriate way and engaging trusted, local influencers to build credibility.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nWe have a framework of <strong>5 Customer Funnels</strong> you can use to follow the customer through their product journey and ideas on how you can bring them along each step of the way (Figure 1).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>5 Customer Funnels</strong>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Acquisition</strong> – People come to your site after they’ve heard about you through email, press, blogs, word of mouth, and other paid or unpaid channels.</li>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n	<li><strong>Activation</strong> – If people like what they see on the landing page, email invitation, app store or other form of advertising they’ll become users by creating an account and beginning   their free trial.</li>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n	<li><strong>Retention</strong> – Users come back to the app through unsolicited use, emails reminders or push notifications and stay active through features they encounter while using the product.</li>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n	<li><strong>Revenue</strong> – You monetize active users through paid subscriptions.</li>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n	<li><strong>Referral</strong> – Active users refer others through viral product features and other incentives.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<a href="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/figure_1.png"><img src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/figure_1-300x159.png" alt="figure_1" width="300" height="159" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-302" /></a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nFigure 1\r\n&nbsp;\r\nLet’s take a deeper dive into each of these.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>Acquisition &amp; Activation</strong>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThis is all about getting customers interested in what you have to offer (acquisition) and getting them to begin the trial (activation).

What is the end-benefit you’re offering, in 1 short sentence.  An attention grabber.</li>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n	<li>Sub-headline or a 2-3 sentence paragraph.

Prior to actually acquiring customers, you’ll want to answer some questions to help refine messaging for the product.\r\n\r\nTo begin, let’s define the value proposition – the primary reason a customer should buy from you.  Once defined, this is first thing visitors should see on the landing page and all major entry points.\r\n\r\nAnswers (from people who could become real customers) on a few basic questions can help to determine the language of your customer and further define your value proposition.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>How can I save or acquire more time/money/information using this product?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>How can improve my perceived worth/quality in front of my clients/peers?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>How can I feel personally rewarded?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nExamples of product features/benefits and opportunities from these 3 questions include the following:\r\n<strong>How can I save or acquire more time/money/information using this product?</strong>\r\n\r\nPre-choreographed music and workouts saves you time.\r\n\r\nLess expensive than DVD’s\r\n\r\nAccess content only available here\r\n\r\nTeach classes anywhere\r\n\r\n<strong>How can improve my perceived worth/quality in front of my clients/peers?</strong>\r\n\r\nContent updated regularly to keep classes fresh\r\n\r\n<strong>How can I feel personally rewarded?</strong>\r\n\r\nEarly access to events\r\n\r\nExclusive offers/promotions\r\n\r\nOn your product landing page then, the value proposition is usually a block of text (a headline, sub-headline and one paragraph of text) with a visual (photo, hero shot, graphics).\r\n\r\nThere is no one right way to go about it, but I suggest you start with the following formula:\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Headline.

Prior to actually acquiring customers, you’ll want to answer some questions to help refine messaging for the product.\r\n\r\nTo begin, let’s define the value proposition – the primary reason a customer should buy from you.  Once defined, this is first thing visitors should see on the landing page and all major entry points.\r\n\r\nAnswers (from people who could become real customers) on a few basic questions can help to determine the language of your customer and further define your value proposition.\r\n<ol>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>How can I save or acquire more time/money/information using this product?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>How can improve my perceived worth/quality in front of my clients/peers?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>How can I feel personally rewarded?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nExamples of product features/benefits and opportunities from these 3 questions include the following:\r\n<strong>How can I save or acquire more time/money/information using this product?</strong>\r\n\r\nPre-choreographed music and workouts saves you time.\r\n\r\nLess expensive than DVD’s\r\n\r\nAccess content only available here\r\n\r\nTeach classes anywhere\r\n\r\n<strong>How can improve my perceived worth/quality in front of my clients/peers?</strong>\r\n\r\nContent updated regularly to keep classes fresh\r\n\r\n<strong>How can I feel personally rewarded?</strong>\r\n\r\nEarly access to events\r\n\r\nExclusive offers/promotions\r\n\r\nOn your product landing page then, the value proposition is usually a block of text (a headline, sub-headline and one paragraph of text) with a visual (photo, hero shot, graphics).\r\n\r\nThere is no one right way to go about it, but I suggest you start with the following formula:\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Headline. What is the end-benefit you’re offering, in 1 short sentence.  An attention grabber.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Sub-headline or a 2-3 sentence paragraph.

Every new solution can benefit from a well-designed demonstration. The free trial along with a video tutorial or other interactive content helps show which aspects of your solution pose the biggest perceived risk to your customer.\r\n\r\nOn top of this, other marketing activities to consider include the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Landing page optimization\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Making the product simple to purchase and easy to try before they buy.</li>\r\n	<li>Creating a remarkable customer experience through design and content.</li>\r\n	<li>Creating a separate product landing page to accurately track and manage.</li>\r\n	<li>Site A/B Testing to optimize copy and design.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Email\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Testing email campaigns to optimize conversion</li>\r\n	<li>Evaluating open, click thru and conversion rates</li>\r\n	<li>Auto-responder if cart abandonment</li>\r\n	<li>Automate remarketing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>SEO\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Capture interested potential customers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Content Marketing\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Leveraging blog posts, infographics, and videos to increase awareness and site traffic</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Paid Acquisition\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Search engine marketing (Google AdWords; Facebook ads; display ads; mobile ads).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNext, establish credibility by aligning customer influencers.

Prior to actually acquiring customers, you’ll want to answer some questions to help refine messaging for the product.\r\n\r\nTo begin, let’s define the value proposition – the primary reason a customer should buy from you.  Once defined, this is first thing visitors should see on the landing page and all major entry points.\r\n\r\nAnswers (from people who could become real customers) on a few basic questions can help to determine the language of your customer and further define your value proposition.\r\n<ol>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>How can I save or acquire more time/money/information using this product?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>How can improve my perceived worth/quality in front of my clients/peers?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>How can I feel personally rewarded?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nExamples of product features/benefits and opportunities from these 3 questions include the following:\r\n<strong>How can I save or acquire more time/money/information using this product?</strong>\r\n\r\nPre-choreographed music and workouts saves you time.\r\n\r\nLess expensive than DVD’s\r\n\r\nAccess content only available here\r\n\r\nTeach classes anywhere\r\n\r\n<strong>How can improve my perceived worth/quality in front of my clients/peers?</strong>\r\n\r\nContent updated regularly to keep classes fresh\r\n\r\n<strong>How can I feel personally rewarded?</strong>\r\n\r\nEarly access to events\r\n\r\nExclusive offers/promotions\r\n\r\nOn your product landing page then, the value proposition is usually a block of text (a headline, sub-headline and one paragraph of text) with a visual (photo, hero shot, graphics).\r\n\r\nThere is no one right way to go about it, but I suggest you start with the following formula:\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Headline.

Prior to actually acquiring customers, you’ll want to answer some questions to help refine messaging for the product.\r\n\r\nTo begin, let’s define the value proposition – the primary reason a customer should buy from you.  Once defined, this is first thing visitors should see on the landing page and all major entry points.\r\n\r\nAnswers (from people who could become real customers) on a few basic questions can help to determine the language of your customer and further define your value proposition.\r\n<ol>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>How can I save or acquire more time/money/information using this product?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>How can improve my perceived worth/quality in front of my clients/peers?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>How can I feel personally rewarded?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nExamples of product features/benefits and opportunities from these 3 questions include the following:\r\n<strong>How can I save or acquire more time/money/information using this product?</strong>\r\n\r\nPre-choreographed music and workouts saves you time.\r\n\r\nLess expensive than DVD’s\r\n\r\nAccess content only available here\r\n\r\nTeach classes anywhere\r\n\r\n<strong>How can improve my perceived worth/quality in front of my clients/peers?</strong>\r\n\r\nContent updated regularly to keep classes fresh\r\n\r\n<strong>How can I feel personally rewarded?</strong>\r\n\r\nEarly access to events\r\n\r\nExclusive offers/promotions\r\n\r\nOn your product landing page then, the value proposition is usually a block of text (a headline, sub-headline and one paragraph of text) with a visual (photo, hero shot, graphics).\r\n\r\nThere is no one right way to go about it, but I suggest you start with the following formula:\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Headline. What is the end-benefit you’re offering, in 1 short sentence.  An attention grabber.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Sub-headline or a 2-3 sentence paragraph.

List the key benefits or features.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Visual. Images communicate much faster than words. Show the product, the hero shot or an image reinforcing your main message.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Solve their objections</strong>\r\n\r\nNext, make it easy for them to begin. Supporting value add-copy can help reduce reasons a customer may not purchase or begin a trial.  Examples include:\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Free trial</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Monthly to Month agreement, cancel any time</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Money-back guarantee</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Limited time discount</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDemonstrating the actual, tangible solution is often the best way to introduce something new. Every new solution can benefit from a well-designed demonstration. The free trial along with a video tutorial or other interactive content helps show which aspects of your solution pose the biggest perceived risk to your customer.\r\n\r\nOn top of this, other marketing activities to consider include the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Landing page optimization\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Making the product simple to purchase and easy to try before they buy.</li>\r\n	<li>Creating a remarkable customer experience through design and content.</li>\r\n	<li>Creating a separate product landing page to accurately track and manage.</li>\r\n	<li>Site A/B Testing to optimize copy and design.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Email\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Testing email campaigns to optimize conversion</li>\r\n	<li>Evaluating open, click thru and conversion rates</li>\r\n	<li>Auto-responder if cart abandonment</li>\r\n	<li>Automate remarketing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>SEO\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Capture interested potential customers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Content Marketing\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Leveraging blog posts, infographics, and videos to increase awareness and site traffic</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Paid Acquisition\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Search engine marketing (Google AdWords; Facebook ads; display ads; mobile ads).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNext, establish credibility by aligning customer influencers.

Prior to actually acquiring customers, you’ll want to answer some questions to help refine messaging for the product.\r\n\r\nTo begin, let’s define the value proposition – the primary reason a customer should buy from you.  Once defined, this is first thing visitors should see on the landing page and all major entry points.\r\n\r\nAnswers (from people who could become real customers) on a few basic questions can help to determine the language of your customer and further define your value proposition.\r\n\r\nHow can I save or acquire more time/money/information using this product?\r\n \r\n\r\nHow can improve my perceived worth/quality in front of my clients/peers?\r\n \r\n\r\nHow can I feel personally rewarded?\r\n \r\n\r\nExamples of product features/benefits and opportunities from these 3 questions include the following:\r\nHow can I save or acquire more time/money/information using this product?\r\n\r\nPre-choreographed music and workouts saves you time.\r\n\r\nLess expensive than DVD’s\r\n\r\nAccess content only available here\r\n\r\nTeach classes anywhere\r\n\r\nHow can improve my perceived worth/quality in front of my clients/peers?\r\n\r\nContent updated regularly to keep classes fresh\r\n\r\nHow can I feel personally rewarded?\r\n\r\nEarly access to events\r\n\r\nExclusive offers/promotions\r\n\r\nOn your product landing page then, the value proposition is usually a block of text (a headline, sub-headline and one paragraph of text) with a visual (photo, hero shot, graphics).\r\n\r\nThere is no one right way to go about it, but I suggest you start with the following formula:\r\n\r\nHeadline. What is the end-benefit you’re offering, in 1 short sentence.  An attention grabber.\r\n \r\n\r\nSub-headline or a 2-3 sentence paragraph. A specific explanation of what you do/offer, for whom and why is it useful.\r\n \r\n\r\n3 bullet points. List the key benefits or features.\r\n \r\n\r\nVisual.

Supporting value add-copy can help reduce reasons a customer may not purchase or begin a trial.  Examples include:\r\n\r\nFree trial\r\n \r\n\r\nMonthly to Month agreement, cancel any time\r\n \r\n\r\nMoney-back guarantee\r\n \r\n\r\nLimited time discount\r\n \r\n\r\nDemonstrating the actual, tangible solution is often the best way to introduce something new. Every new solution can benefit from a well-designed demonstration. The free trial along with a video tutorial or other interactive content helps show which aspects of your solution pose the biggest perceived risk to your customer.\r\n\r\nOn top of this, other marketing activities to consider include the following:\r\n\r\nLanding page optimization\r\nMaking the product simple to purchase and easy to try before they buy.\r\nCreating a remarkable customer experience through design and content.\r\nCreating a separate product landing page to accurately track and manage.\r\nSite A/B Testing to optimize copy and design.\r\n \r\n\r\nEmail\r\nTesting email campaigns to optimize conversion\r\nEvaluating open, click thru and conversion rates\r\nAuto-responder if cart abandonment\r\nAutomate remarketing\r\n \r\n\r\nSEO\r\nCapture interested potential customers\r\n \r\n\r\nContent Marketing\r\nLeveraging blog posts, infographics, and videos to increase awareness and site traffic\r\n \r\n\r\nPaid Acquisition\r\nSearch engine marketing (Google AdWords; Facebook ads; display ads; mobile ads).\r\n \r\n\r\nNext, establish credibility by aligning customer influencers. Who do your customers listen to in the your industry?\r\n\r\nGet their early buy-in, familiarization with the product and recognize them for their importance to the company.\r\nSelective extended trials (a full year) exchange for testimonials. Capture written and video testimonials about the benefits of the program\r\nSocial Media\r\nHave a coordinated/scripted social medial messaging and cadence developed for their use.\r\n \r\n\r\nRetention:\r\n\r\nThe number one goal is to have customer retention. Successfully solving a customer’s problem and continuing to engage them enables a long-standing relationship to develop.\r\n\r\nEngagement is built into the product, as this is a critical component to long-term program success.\r\n\r\nSome goals with retention are to maintain the buzz and excitement of the product and deepen the connection with the community of subscribers.\r\n\r\nLive conversations\r\nSpeaking with a small number of active customers and those who cancelled.  Provides great feedback about what is working well and more importantly what needs to be improved.\r\nSurveys\r\nUse tools including Survey Monkey and Net Promoter Score (a good leading indicator of other metrics) to measure their willingness to refer the product and affinity for existing or proposed features.\r\nEmail/Push\r\n \r\n\r\nAuto-responder emails are built into our platform based on user interaction with the app.\r\nPush notifications with content updates and encourage social sharing\r\nExclusive member newsletter or email communication and promotions.\r\nRevenue:\r\n\r\nWith a simple monthly subscription and reasonable rates there’s not much do here.  If you are having issues with retention it’s either a product or pricing problem.\r\n\r\nCommunicating with customers is a sure way to find our what they want from the product.\r\n\r\nReferral:\r\n\r\nWith any great solution, this will happen naturally, but probably not as quickly as you would like. It is important to look for points where you can influence the natural process to accelerate widespread adoption and to provide easy ways for people to talk and share about the program.\r\n\r\nBuilding buzz: recommendations & referrals\r\nEncourage users to share through social media\r\nSales reps and industry partners\r\nWhere to begin\r\n\r\nIt’s impossible to focus your efforts on each of these steps at the same time.  Choose one of the five funnels and focus relentlessly on improving, then reassess and begin again. We recommend a 5 Step process for considerations when planning your efforts.\r\n\r\nPrioritize the plan. What are the 1 or 2 metrics we want to improve?\r\nList our intent. Why do we want to change?\r\nList the customer friction to solve. What’s the user experience problem?\r\nDetermine baseline conversion. What is the current status?\r\nConsider potential lift from test. How much do we expect to gain?\r\nAs an example, let’s assume we are in the acquisition phase and we’ve already emailed an invitation to begin the free trial to a portion of the potential customer list.

Prior to actually acquiring customers, you’ll want to answer some questions to help refine messaging for the product.\r\n\r\nTo begin, let’s define the value proposition – the primary reason a customer should buy from you.

What is the current status?</li>\r\n	<li>Consider potential lift from test. How much do we expect to gain?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nAs an example, let’s assume we are in the acquisition phase and we’ve already emailed an invitation to begin the free trial to a portion of the potential customer list. We’ve noticed the open rates of the email are lower than expected.\r\n\r\nGoing through the 5 Steps is as follows:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>We want to improve email open rates</li>\r\n	<li>To increase the number of people who have the opportunity to begin a free trial</li>\r\n	<li>They aren’t finding the subject line compelling enough to open</li>\r\n	<li>Current open rates are 20%</li>\r\n	<li>Expect a 10% lift with a change to the subject line</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nOr, another example would be this:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>We want to improve the number of site visits to the app landing page from people not on our mailing list.</li>\r\n	<li>To increase the number of people who have the opportunity to experience our brand and begin a free trial</li>\r\n	<li>People outside of our permission marketing channels aren’t aware of what the app</li>\r\n	<li>Current organic site visits account for 5% of traffic</li>\r\n	<li>Request our current users to rate the app in the app store will improve the app ranking and increase organic site visits to 7.5% within 45 days.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhile having a great product is the most important success factor, a methodical and persistent approach to optimizing the customer funnels will further accelerate sales.', 'Simple Framework to Accelerate Revenue', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '300-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-08-15 02:44:06', '2014-08-15 02:44:06', '', 300, 'http://staging.classcast.co/300-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
